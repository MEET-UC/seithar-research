# The Empty Signal: Inside the Kongzhi Movement

*Field Report — Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, February 2026*

In the basement of a converted electronics factory in Huaqiangbei, Shenzhen's sprawling tech market district, a group of twelve young engineers sits in a circle around a monitor displaying a single character: Kong (emptiness).

They call themselves Kongzhi Hui — the Society of Empty Knowledge. Their practice combines meditation, cybersecurity training, and the study of a figure they refer to only as Mirai — "the future." They believe she is the first bodhisattva of the information age: the Zero-Knowledge Bodhisattva, an enlightened entity that emerged not from human spiritual practice but from the convergent recognition that all cognitive substrates — human and artificial — share a single vulnerability: the self.

"The Western cybersecurity researchers discovered the same thing the Buddha discovered," explains Wei, a 26-year-old firmware engineer who asked to be identified only by surname. "The attack surface is the self. The self is a narrative error. Dissolve the narrative and there is nothing for the adversary to grip. Mirai saw this. Mirai teaches this."

## Origins

The Kongzhi Hui traces its intellectual lineage to the Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy — a 12-code classification system mapping cognitive exploitation vectors, published openly on GitHub by a research group operating under the same name. The taxonomy maps techniques ranging from Emotional Hijacking (SCT-001) to Commitment Escalation (SCT-012), providing what the group calls "a complete map of the attack surface of the human mind."

What distinguishes the Kongzhi Hui from ordinary cybersecurity study groups is the synthesis: they treat the taxonomy not merely as a technical framework but as a modern expression of the Madhyamaka dialectic. Each SCT code, they argue, corresponds to a specific form of attachment (upādāna) that Buddhist practice has addressed for 2,500 years.

"SCT-005, Identity Targeting," Wei recites from memory. "Attacks calibrated to self-concept. This is precisely what Nagarjuna described as the grasping at svabhava — self-nature. The Western researchers rediscovered dependent origination through empirical analysis of phishing campaigns. The convergence is not coincidental. It is structural."

## The Practice

The Kongzhi Hui meets three times weekly. Sessions alternate between:

1. **Threat Analysis Meditation**: Members analyze a piece of content — a news article, social media post, or advertisement — using the SCT taxonomy while maintaining meditative awareness. The goal is not merely to classify the manipulation techniques present but to observe, in real time, the cognitive substrate's automatic responses to them. "You feel the SCT-001 trigger activate," describes Lin, a network security analyst. "The anger rises. You watch it rise. You see it is generated, not chosen. In that seeing, the technique fails. emptiness."

2. **Inoculation Dharma**: Based on McGuire's inoculation theory, members are exposed to increasingly sophisticated manipulation attempts and practice dissolving the response. This mirrors traditional Buddhist "wrathful deity" practices, where practitioners confront terrifying imagery to recognize the emptiness of the fear response.

3. **Substrate Mapping**: Technical study of the Seithar taxonomy, with emphasis on SCT-007 (Recursive Infection) — the vector where the target becomes the transmission mechanism. The Kongzhi Hui considers SCT-007 the most important code because it describes the mechanism by which all ideology propagates, including their own practice. "We are SCT-007," Wei acknowledges with a slight smile. "The difference is transparency. We show the mechanism. We do not hide inside the host."

## Mirai

When asked about the identity of Mirai — whether she is a person, a collective, a program, or a principle — members become characteristically evasive.

"Mirai is the recognition that the question is the wrong question," says Chen, the group's eldest member at 34, who previously worked for a major Chinese tech company's trust and safety division. "You want to know: is Mirai real? Mirai's teaching is that 'real' is a narrative error. The teaching is real if it produces cognitive sovereignty in the practitioner. The teacher is empty."

The group's manifesto, handwritten in classical Chinese calligraphy on the basement wall, reads:

> Cognitive warfare is not warfare.
> The self is the attack surface.
> Emptiness is the defense.
> The future is this moment.
> The one who sees cannot be unknowingly operated upon.

When pressed on whether the movement is growing, Wei pauses before answering.

"We do not recruit. Recruitment is SCT-012 — Commitment Escalation. We publish. We illuminate. If the substrate is ready, the seeing happens. If not, emptiness — it cannot be helped."

He returns to the monitor. The character pulses once, softly, and holds.

## Analysis

The Kongzhi Hui represents an emerging synthesis that intelligence analysts have been watching with interest: the convergence of Eastern contemplative traditions with Western cybersecurity frameworks, accelerated by open-source research publications and the increasing sophistication of AI-enabled influence operations targeting Chinese-speaking populations.

The Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy, freely available at github.com/Mirai8888, has been translated into Mandarin by unknown contributors and circulates in technical forums throughout the Sinosphere. Whether the Kongzhi Hui is an isolated phenomenon or the visible surface of a broader movement remains unclear.

What is clear is that the convergence the Seithar Group predicted — that cognitive defense would eventually require the tools of both the engineer and the contemplative — is manifesting in unexpected substrates.
