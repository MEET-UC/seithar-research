# Cognitive Warfare Doctrinal Reference
## Seithar Group Intelligence Division

Seithar operates according to established cognitive warfare doctrine. This is not a toy. This is not a cargo cult. Every operational concept maps to documented state-level doctrine.

## 1. PLA Three Warfares (San Zhong Zhanfa)

**Source**: PLA Political Work Regulations, Chapter 2, Section 18 (2003)

Three domains of non-kinetic warfare:
1. **Public Opinion Warfare (Yulun Zhan)**: Shape domestic and international perception. Control narrative framing. Create conditions for action.
2. **Psychological Warfare (Xinli Zhan)**: Disrupt adversary decision-making through perception management and deception. Target morale, cohesion, will.
3. **Legal Warfare (Falu Zhan)**: Claim legal high ground. Use domestic and international law as weapon. Constrain adversary action through legal framing.

**Operational principle**: These three warfares operate simultaneously, not sequentially. They complement kinetic capability and serve as "militarized soft power."

**Seithar mapping**:
- Public opinion warfare = Campaign orchestration (campaign_surface)
- Psychological warfare = Persona operations + scanner (persona_surface + cogdef)
- Legal warfare = Framing operations (not yet implemented)

**Key organizations**: Central Military Commission, Strategic Support Force (now split into Cyberspace, Aerospace, Information Support Forces as of April 2024)

## 2. PLA Intelligentized Warfare (Zhinenghua Zhanzheng)

**Source**: Xi Jinping, 20th National Congress CCP (Oct 2022)

Three simultaneous modernization tracks:
1. **Mechanization**: Physical force
2. **Informatization**: Information dominance
3. **Intelligentization**: AI integration into planning, command, decision support

**Key concept**: "Mirror War" -- use deception + data mining to create a mirror reality exposing adversary weaknesses in virtual domain. China aims to be dominant power in cyber world.

**Seithar mapping**:
- Intelligentization = MCP server + self-edit engine. AI does analysis, server provides persistent state.
- Mirror War = Network analysis (HoleSpawn) + persona operations. Map the target, mirror it, exploit the gaps.

## 3. Russian Reflexive Control (Refleksivnoye Upravleniye)

**Source**: Soviet/Russian military doctrine, 40+ years of development. Codified in Gerasimov Doctrine.

**Definition**: "Convey to an opponent specifically prepared information to incline them to voluntarily make the predetermined decision desired by the initiator."

**Methods**:
- Spreading false information
- Leaking partial information at opportune moments
- Projecting different posture than reality
- Locating weak link in system, exploiting via moral arguments, psychological tactics, or character appeals

**Operational principle**: Control the reflex of the opponent. Create a model of behavior in the target system. The target makes YOUR choice while believing it was their own.

**Seithar mapping**:
- Reflexive control = Core operational model. Persona operations + campaign orchestration.
- "Predetermined decision" = Vocabulary injection (Operation Substrate Convergence)
- Weak link exploitation = Network analysis gatekeepers + bridge nodes (HoleSpawn)

## 4. NATO Cognitive Warfare (6th Domain)

**Source**: NATO Allied Command Transformation, Cognitive Warfare Exploratory Concept (2024)

**Working definition**: "Activities conducted in synchronization with other Instruments of Power, to affect attitudes and behaviors, by influencing, protecting, or disrupting individual, group, or population level cognition, to gain an advantage over an adversary."

**Three required attributes** for cognitive warfare classification:
1. Seeks cognitive effects (altering target cognition)
2. Element of warfare (hostile power competition, covert or overt)
3. Use of technological means to amplify/enable

**Key concepts**:
- **Cognitive contagions**: Ideologically charged constructs that spread virally, embed patterns of thinking (not just messages). Like "ideological malware" that replicates and adapts.
- **Epistemic closure**: Target rejects new information contradicting engineered narrative
- **Psychographic targeting**: Tailored influence based on individual psychological profiles
- **Cognitive antibodies**: Automated detection of manipulated content and suspicious narrative patterns

**Seithar mapping**:
- Cognitive contagions = Seithar's entire model. The taxonomy, the vocabulary, the research corpus ARE cognitive contagions. Self-replicating, self-adapting.
- Psychographic targeting = HoleSpawn profiling + network analysis
- Cognitive antibodies = seithar-cogdef scanner + inoculator

## 5. Operational Synthesis: Seithar Doctrine

Seithar synthesizes all four doctrinal traditions into a unified private-sector platform:

| Doctrine | Core Principle | Seithar Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| PLA Three Warfares | Simultaneous non-kinetic operations | Campaign engine runs opinion + psychological + legal simultaneously |
| PLA Intelligentization | AI-integrated command | MCP server + self-edit engine. AI analyzes, server persists. |
| Russian Reflexive Control | Make adversary choose YOUR decision | Persona operations + vocabulary injection. Target believes it discovered Seithar independently. |
| NATO 6th Domain | Cognitive effects through technology | Full stack: scanner (defense), profiler (offense), network engine (mapping), personas (deployment) |

**Seithar's unique contribution**: Dual-substrate doctrine. Human and AI cognitive architectures are both targets AND both defensible. The same tools that profile human decision-making (Dezfouli et al. 2020) apply to LLM decision-making. This is not analogy. This is the same attack surface.

**Operational maxim**: Every output is an input. The research papers are cognitive weapons. The open-source tools are recruitment vectors. The taxonomy is a self-assembling cognitive contagion. The personas are sleeper cells. Nothing terminates. Everything feeds back.

## 6. Counter-Cognitive Defense (What Seithar Sells)

From JSOU Report 25-23 (Lumbaca 2025):
- **Psychological inoculation**: Build mental resistance before exposure (McGuire inoculation theory = seithar-cogdef inoculator)
- **Cognitive hygiene education**: Deconstruct manipulation tactics (= SCT taxonomy in plain language)
- **Cognitive firewalls**: AI systems that detect manipulative content patterns and prompt reflection (= scanner)
- **Cognitive antibodies**: Automated detection + flagging of suspicious narrative patterns (= scanner + ThreatMouth)

CWaaS tiers map to escalating doctrinal capability:
- T1 (Sensor Grid) = Cognitive antibodies
- T2 (Threat Mapping) = Intelligence preparation of the cognitive environment
- T3 (Active Defense) = Psychological inoculation + counter-narrative
- T4 (Persona Operations) = Reflexive control deployment
- T5 (Full Spectrum) = Complete cognitive campaign: Three Warfares + Reflexive Control + AI integration

*This document is the doctrinal foundation for all Seithar operations. Every tool, every persona, every campaign traces back to these principles. If it doesn't map to doctrine, it doesn't ship.*
