EDITORS’ FOREWORD 
 
 
 
2020 was a singular year for the Cognitive Security & Education Forum 
(COGSEC, cogsec.org), as it was for many others. In light of this 
paradigm-shifting year, we leave it for future dates and other authors 
to digest the proceedings of 2020. Rather than a recap of momentous 
events, this foreword’s contribution will be the contextualization of the 
book you are reading now: “The Great Preset: Remote Teams and 
Operational Art”. This edited volume is a compilation of the traces that 
COGSEC and collaborators left during 2020. In this foreword we will 
briefly review the initial and updated intentions of COGSEC, then 
distill the contribution of each chapter, before closing with intentions 
for 2021 and beyond.  
The original intention of COGSEC in early 2020 was to improve the 
state of knowledge management through developing computational 
tools related to user interfaces, databases, and filetype standardization. 
Over the course of our early research, we came to understand that 
knowledge management is a fundamentally social and collaborative 
process. So, while computational tools and data standards are indeed 
enabling factors for successful knowledge management systems, they 
are part of a much larger constellation of essential system attributes. 
Our investigations into this larger constellation initially led to topics 

---PAGE BREAK---
vi    The Great Preset 
 
such as narratives, memetics, team life cycle studies, and organizational 
psychology. Later, we began to include perspectives from physics, 
anthropology, mathematics, and complexity science. What had begun 
as a private sequence of product development design sprints, over the 
course of the year evolved into a research program with global 
participation. Along the way, we “learned by doing”. Through practice 
and collaborators, we came to new realizations about our system of 
interest: online organizations. The chapters of this book are ordered 
chronologically, and if published elsewhere, include a note 
accompanying the abstract. 
In Chapter 1, “Emergent Teams for Complex Threats,” we searched 
for insights into knowledge management and team dynamics from the 
area of counterterrorism efforts. We found that the capacity to 
reorganize rapidly, maintain resilience, and integrate new information 
channels are instrumental for both successful terrorist and 
counterterrorist activity. These flexibilities and feedback processes are 
especially important when dealing with complex threat surfaces, which 
are characterized by their potential to induce non-linear and cascading 
failure modes if exploited.  
In Chapter 2, “Infinite Games for Infinite Teams,” we explored the 
intersection of online teams, memes, and games. Cognitive overload 
and adversarial dynamics beset online teams of all kinds, whether they 
be professional research groups or emergent cliques on anonymized 
forums. The open question is how to design online or hybrid spaces 
that are healthy and participatory. Our contribution here was the 
exploration of role-based group improvisational and cultural dynamics 
in the context of rapidly assembled modern online teams, and the 
provision of several initial “Infinite Game” structures with application 
in research, development, and citizen science domains.  
In Chapter 3, “Active Inference & Behavior Engineering for Teams,” 
we approached online team design with insights from systems 
engineering and the emerging physics-based framework of active 
inference. Active inference frames the dynamics of goal-seeking

systems in terms of their actions, as oriented towards reducing 
uncertainty about the statistical regularities in their niche or operating 
environment. Our contribution here was to bring together the areas of 
engineering, narrative communication, multiscale systems thinking, 
and active inference, with an eye towards developing new tools and 
modes of work for online teams. 
In Chapter 4, “The Facilitator’s Catechism,” we reviewed the historical 
development of the Operations Order (OPORD) from antiquity to the 
modern day. We found that historically, changes in technological and 
organizational complexity necessitated novel formats and applications 
of OPORDs. Taking stock of recent developments in research & 
development, we presented a novel “Facilitator’s Catechism” that 
builds on the Heilmeier Catechism and is designed to catalyze the 
development of emergent research teams in various settings.   
In Chapter 5, “Reimagining Maps,” we surveyed recent developments 
in geospatial mapping techniques, in the context of various types of 
extra-cartographic “maps” such as genetic, mathematical, and 
informational. Our contribution here was to find the challenges in 
common between various mapping domains and how they are being 
or have been addressed in order to reveal paths to solutions which may 
be generalizable. 
In Chapter 6, “The Innovator’s Catechism,” we traced the history of 
OPORDs in the business context, from the early programs in 
entrepreneurial education through the current day’s drive for 
integration in early-stage startups. We highlighted the value of fusing 
approaches derived from large high-reliability organizations and small 
agile startups. We also presented an initial version of the “Innovator’s 
Catechism”, an interactive document that derives from the 
“Facilitator’s Catechism” and is modified to include features relevant 
for today’s entrepreneurial ecosystem.  
Building upon the research of 2020, we will initially consider the 
detection, classification, and design of Narrative Information

Management (NIM) systems. Narrative Information Management is 
the process of tracking, detecting, compressing, and storing 
information about narrative and memetic content. As an entry point to 
our study of NIM systems in 2021, we intend to explore communities 
of practice that are using platforms that act as ad hoc NIM systems. 
Our aim will be to find methods of expediting and stabilizing 
sensemaking, especially in the domains of education, research, 
communication, and innovation. 
As the sun sets on 2020, we can look to what 2021 may bring for the 
collaborative nexus that is COGSEC. We strive for rigorous, 
productive, and meaningful collaborations. In early 2021 or any future 
moment, we are calling for collaborators who are interested in helping 
to build a more resilient future (see cogsec.org for updated information 
on participation).

CHAPTER I 
Emergent Teams  
for Complex Threats 
Richard J. Cordes & Daniel A. Friedman 
 
ABSTRACT 
While the underlying, fundamental principles of warfare have long 
remained unchanged, recent social and technological developments 
have necessitated new approaches to conflict management. 
Specifically, the introduction of nuclear weapons and the maintenance 
of large military budgets during peacetime in the latter half of the 20th 
century have changed the risk calculus of conflict among state and non-
state actors. Consequently, the operating environment has changed. 
Extant, centralized actors have experienced new adversities such as 
ideological warfare and sustained low-intensity and gray zone conflict 
while new, decentralized participants have emerged and evolved. 
Nation states, as a part of normal operations, now have to contend 
with the potential for novel, emergent hazards in a myriad of, littoral 
and other environments. In this chapter we introduce the concept of a 
Complex Threat Surface to capture these non-linear failure modes of 
small and large organizations. We highlight how Complexity Science 
has been of use in the analysis of Complex Threat Surfaces in the 
military and within civilian organizations, particularly High Reliability 
Organizations or HROs. This paper also discusses the intersection of 
Complexity Science and Military Science by focusing on analysis of 
counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations. We highlight 
rapid reorganization, pooling collective expertise, and the assembly of 
novel organizational components as a potential basis for developing 
spontaneous expertise, actionable intelligence, and solutions to the 
aforementioned emergent hazards of Complex Threat Surfaces.

2    The Great Preset 
 
Introduction 
This paper uses a Complexity Science framework to investigate the 
relationship between the rapid assembly of teams and the success of 
counterinsurgency and related efforts. Beginning with a vignette of the 
2008 attack on Mumbai by Lashkar-e-Taiba, general ideas and trends 
in Military Science related to counterinsurgency efforts and Complex 
Threat Surfaces will be discussed. This introduction of Complex Threat 
Surfaces will be followed by a discussion of Complexity Science as an 
approach for modeling and de-risking Complex Threats. In alignment 
with literature on both High Reliability Organizations and Complexity 
Science, reorganization and adaptation are addressed as potential 
avenues for responding to novel, emergent problems. Finally, Rapid 
Team Assembly is presented at the intersection of Complexity and 
Military Science as a basis for developing spontaneous expertise, 
actionable intelligence, and solutions to novel, emergent problems. We 
conclude with a discussion of best practices and opportunities for 
future work. 
Lessons from Mumbai 
To understand how Complexity Science, rapid assembly of teams, 
counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, and other related efforts are 
linked, we begin with a recollection of the 2008 attack on Mumbai. On 
November 23rd, 2008, ten men in their early twenties left the Pakistani 
port city of Karachi by boat. This group carried light armament, some 
fire-starting material, fake passports, and satellite phones [1,2]. They set 
out for Mumbai, the seventh most populous city in the world, a mega-
city of more than fourteen million people, the capital of the Indian 
State Maharashtra [3]. Enroute, the group hijacked a fishing vessel 
registered in Mumbai, murdered its crew [1,4], and forced the captain 
to re-introduce the vessel into normal fleet traffic [5]. On November 
26th, seven kilometers from Mumbai’s coastline, the captain was killed. 
With the vessel fully under control, the ten men begin their approach 
toward the shore. By 8:10 p.m. that evening, the group of ten split into 
two groups, one going ashore and the other continuing by boat. By

8:30 p.m., both groups had fragmented again, resulting in five teams. 
Now dressed in casual clothes to blend with the local population, each 
of the five teams made their approach toward their respective targets 
[1,4,6]. By 9 p.m., improvised explosive devices (IEDs) had been left 
in the taxis which transported the individuals to these locations [7]. 
Upon arriving, they maneuvered and fired indiscriminately into 
restaurants, train stations, and social establishments near their 
respective locations. At 9:38 p.m., a pair assaulted the Taj Mahal Hotel 
from the main lobby, killing twenty non-combatants within the first 
few minutes [7]. 
By 10 p.m. there were explosions at gas stations, civilians had been 
taken 
hostage, 
and 
police, 
accompanied 
by 
three 
senior 
counterterrorism agents, had not only been counterattacked but 
successfully ambushed before even arriving on the scene. The van they 
were ambushed in was then hijacked and used to carry out attacks with 
a surviving officer sitting paralyzed in the backseat [1,8]. It is around 
this time that Zabiuddin Ansari, a phone-operator working from a 
command post in Pakistan made a call by satellite phone to a subunit 
which was hardening its position in a hotel. It is on this call that he 
states the following: “Tell [the Indian Media] this is just the trailer. The 
real movie is yet to come” [1,2,7,9,10]. This message, in retrospect, 
could be viewed as hauntingly accurate. Despite the deployment of a 
counterterrorism force which had superior training, equipment, and 
support, the attackers, acting as semi-autonomous groups with minimal 
equipment, managed to keep a city of over fourteen million people 
under siege for three days. By the end of the conflict, 172 people were 
dead and 308 were wounded [1]. Some background on the group and 
the basis for their relative success will be discussed. 
The group responsible for training the young men in the attack was 
Lashkar-e-Taiba [1], meaning “The Army of the Pure” [11,12]. 
Lashkar-e-Taiba is primarily concerned with removing Indian military 
presence from Jammu and Kashmir and is composed of religious 
radicals affiliated with an ultra-orthodox form of Sunni Islam. In 
compliance with their beliefs, the group is known for foregoing suicide 

---PAGE BREAK---

missions, in favor of “dare-devil” missions [1]. Despite being a banned 
terrorist organization within Pakistan, they maintain multiple training 
and operational camps in the Pakistan-controlled sub-regions within 
Kashmir [11] and their operations frequently result in links to the ISI, 
or Inter-Services Intelligence, the primary intelligence agency of 
Pakistan [13–17]. This is unsurprising, given the ISI’s involvement in 
the dismantling of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the 
resulting close ties with liberation movements and guerilla operations 
in the region [15,18]. 
ISI has nurtured a thriving market for illegally trafficked goods for 
decades, even going as far as using the National Logistic Cell (NLC), a 
logistics company nationalized by the Pakistani Army which was used 
to supply arms to the Mujahideen in Afghanistan, to run drugs over the 
same routes [18,19]. Intelligence estimates in 1992 suggested that 
Pakistani drug dealers had amassed the world’s largest stockpile of 
opium and heroin [15,18]. As indicated by their use of the NLC, ISI 
does not just passively allow this environment of criminality, they are 
an active part of it. Apprehended drug traffickers and scouts from 
Norway and Japan admitted that their handlers had close ties with 
generals in the region [18,19]. The insurgencies in the neighboring 
regions made the arms trade lucrative, and, as stated earlier, ISI has 
been involved in trafficking directly. While access to funding, 
munitions, and armament, and lack of meaningful government 
oversight in the regions in which they operated, enabled Lashkar-e-
Taiba’s operations in 2008 [1,11], they were not the primary factors in 
the group’s success. Across all notable analyses reviewed, there was a 
conclusion in common regarding the causes of their success: superior 
information and exploitation of OSINT, or open-source intelligence, 
as a basis for rapid, spontaneous planning and for reorganization [1,6–
8,20]. 
The group made notable efforts prior to the event to develop 
actionable intelligence and a working knowledge of the intended area 
of operations. The terrorists applied for jobs in the kitchen, booked 
rooms at the hotel, and visited and mapped buildings. Most of the 

---PAGE BREAK---
Emergent Teams for Complex Threats    5 
 
information they used to plan and modify operations was open-source 
and available to the public. The groups made use of back entrances and 
corridors not open to civilians and barely known by the reacting 
counterterrorism force and used these areas, discovered in prior 
reconnaissance, to counterattack the counterterrorists, ambush 
civilians, and escape and evade when outmatched [6,8,21]. During the 
event, a command center in Pakistan was in contact with the group 
using satellite phones. The command center used live news and Twitter 
to inform decision-making and to inform personnel on the ground of 
counterterrorism operations [20]. In one notable incident, a tweet with 
a picture posted by the BBC revealed the position and intent of a 
counterterrorism unit on the ground in real-time, resulting in a 
counterattack [6]. Marc Goodman, an authority on terrorist use of 
open-source data, in a talk on the topic, noted that while terrorists had 
used public-access tools such as Twitter and Google Earth before, this 
was the first notable event in which they mined social media data in 
real time and did so at such a scale [20]. The groups confirmed potential 
high value targets by using Google and social media, remapped 
operations using tweets, GPS devices, and Google Earth, and even 
intercepted communications at the hotel, alerting the terrorists to room 
numbers of high-value targets [7,20,21]. 
In contrast to Lashkar-e-Taiba’s OSINT-informed improvisation and 
spontaneous planning, counterterrorist forces were continuously 
delayed by lack of flexibility. The Indian emergency planners had 
planned for scenarios similar to the 2008 Mumbai attack, but “lacked a 
modular and flexible structure when it came to communicating and 
responding in a non-routine fashion” [22]. In some cases, the lack of a 
QRF (quick reaction force) in Mumbai was noted as a basis for failure, 
however, this may be misleading, as various QRF elements were 
available but unused. Among other examples, the Indian Navy had 
assets stationed in Mumbai at the time of the attack but lacked the 
necessary signed release to use military assets in civilian domains [6], 
and a special forces unit with the Indian Army was delayed due to the 
lack of “their own air assets” to travel to the site [6,23]. It may be 
important to note that the Indian Government had access to all of the 

---PAGE BREAK---
6    The Great Preset 
 
same information the terrorists did but failed to assemble specialists 
who could have made use of the data and funnel analysis to the 
individuals who could have leveraged incoming information [1,6,20]. 
Shivshankar Menon, India’s Prime Minister at the time of the attack, 
noted afterward: “[the key was rapid analysis]… we didn’t have it.” [9]. 
While traditional metrics for readiness and capability might indicate 
that the conflict was significantly asymmetric in favor of the 
counterterrorists (e.g. monetary value of equipment, personnel count, 
extent of training), this vignette supports the findings of other analyses 
on asymmetry, which indicate that such metrics may not necessarily be 
representative of the balance of power or indicate probability of 
outcomes, especially in modern contexts [24,25]. Asymmetry in 
resources having little correlation with success in conflict is 
acknowledged as a recurring phenomenon and is an important 
characteristic of conflict which developed in the latter half of the 20th 
century, [24] the reasons for this emergent characteristic will be 
discussed further. 
Complex Threats in the Gray Zone 
The introduction of nuclear weapons and the maintenance of large 
military budgets by the remaining geopolitical superpowers after the 
conclusion of World War Two [26] created an environment which 
changed the risk calculus of conventional conflict [27,28]. This shift in 
risk is sometimes interpreted as a cause of a “Long Peace” [29] or 
“Nuclear Peace” [28], which, at a glance may be supported by data on 
battle deaths per year [30]. Though this may be true of direct, 
conventional, interstate warfare, this has not necessarily been true for 
military conflict in general. Instead, its “timing, intensity. and 
[outcomes]” have changed [24,28]. Governments have adapted the way 
they conduct conflict, and as a result, nurtured a new domain of 
operations often referred to as “The Gray Zone” [31,32]. Actions 
which are aggressive in nature but moderated in order to prevent 
triggering formal change in diplomatic status (e.g. declarations of war) 
vis-a-vis Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty or Article 51 of the 

---PAGE BREAK---
Emergent Teams for Complex Threats    7 
 
United Nations Charter are classified as Gray Zone Warfare [32–35]. 
Intelligence agencies of many nations, not just superpowers, managed 
conflicts through proxy warfare and by sponsoring non-state actors 
with aligned goals [36]. Often assisted by training from state actors, 
non-state actors used guerilla tactics and operated in a decentralized, 
networked fashion in the interest of self-preservation. One of the 
results of this decentralization has been a deep embedding of these 
non-state actors in local networks, including governments, illicit 
trafficking operations, and religious groups; this embedding blurs the 
line between licit, criminal, and guerilla networks, allowing groups to 
use this embedding as a form of camouflage and a basis to acquire 
resources without sponsors [1,5,11,15,18,19]. As centralized state 
actors learned to react to the new tactics being used against them and 
to practice deterrence, decentralized non-state actors continued to 
evolve, solving complex informational problems such as the imperfect 
monitoring of cells, inter and intragroup communication of activities, 
and reducing risk and cost of operations [37,38]. The smaller size and 
limited resources of non-state actors required them to become resilient 
and adapt where larger nations may have reinforced. More importantly, 
it required them to become more innovative in finding opportunities 
and exploiting weaknesses [39]. 
Based on analyses of the events in Mumbai, the attack can be 
characterized as a successful exploitation of what are defined here as 
“Complex Threat Surfaces”. In hardware security, attack surfaces are 
defined as “the sum of all possible security risk exposures” [40] and in 
practice refer to domains of risk exposure often described in layers [41]. 
The term may have equal value in describing surfaces of attack in 
Military Science and the study of counterterrorism [42]. However, non-
adversarial events are also of interest to National Security, such as the 
response to natural disasters, pandemics, or even post-terrorism clean-
up operations such as hazardous material removal [43], so for the 
purposes of this paper, “attack” is replaced by the more generalizable 
term “threat”. Further, in complex adaptive systems, where “the whole 
is not equal to the sum of the parts”, the common threat surfaces, such 
as those exploited by terrorist groups, may be difficult to defend using 

---PAGE BREAK---

linear methods and offer the potential for difficult to quantify, non-
linear, cascading failure-modes. To this end, the prefix “complex” is 
added to threat surfaces to separate them from the kind of security 
threat surfaces that are considered in risk analysis in hardware. 
Complex Threat Surfaces are thus introduced and defined as surfaces 
that have one or more of the following characteristics: 
• Produce non-linear impact 
o If exploited, yield the potential for novel and cascading 
or nonlinear failure modes 
• Require non-linear and/or adaptive and anticipatory defense 
o Cannot be effectively defended or de-risked linearly, 
intuitively, or by using linear planning mechanisms 
For example, it is likely that the vessel exploited by Lashkar-e-Taiba 
could not have been made much more resilient against a hijacking of 
this kind without preventing it from operating effectively in its normal 
role. After being hijacked, the vessel allowed the group to circumvent 
the linear measures implemented by Mumbai and national littoral, port, 
and customs security. Thus, the fleet of fishing vessels represents an 
archetypal example of a Complex Threat Surface.  In this paper we 
introduce and discuss Complex Threat Surfaces rather than “attack 
surfaces” to emphasize the need for an integrated management 
approach to various kinds of non-linear failure modes. As stated earlier, 
terror and insurgent groups have become more innovative in their 
approach to exploiting weaknesses. Groups are incentivized to 
maximize impact while minimizing risk and cost. This has resulted in a 
focus by terror and insurgent sects on identifying and targeting 
Complex Threat Surfaces, as their inability to be effectively defended 
linearly, intuitively, or by using certain established legacy measures 
minimizes cost of operations and risk of discovery or intervention 
[1,22,31,33,39], as evidenced by the failure of counterterrorism 
measures which successfully red flagged behavior by Lashkar-e-Taiba 
[6] to deter or reduce the efficacy of the Mumbai Attack. In addition 
to reducing cost and risk, because Complex Threat Surfaces represent

opportunities for cascading, non-linear impact, they also offer the 
opportunity to maximize the impact of operations [44–46]. We now 
turn to a discussion of the interdisciplinary paradigm of Complexity 
Science and highlight the role of rapidly assembled teams in responding 
to Complex Threat Surfaces. 
From Complex Threats to Complexity Science 
The science of Complexity, or Complexity Science, is the study of 
systems that are composed of many interacting subunits [47–50]. 
Complex Systems, such as brains or battlefields, often exhibit 
characteristics such as adaptive capacity, radical historicity, self-
organization, and non-linear dynamic behavior. To manage and de-risk 
these 
challenging 
attributes 
of 
Complexity 
Science is 
an 
interdisciplinary field that studies the patterns and principles of 
complex adaptive systems (CAS) in general and specific [47,50–52]. 
Robert Maxfield, a trustee of the Santa Fe Institute, which was founded 
to study complexity, at a symposium on complexity for the National 
Defense University stated that: “The scientifically significant results [of 
Complexity Science] are so far mostly in the physical and biological 
domain, but the metaphors have proven to have tremendous appeal 
and utility in studying humans and human social systems” [53]. Indeed, 
recent decades have seen increased interest in research and applications 
of Complexity approaches in Military, Informational, and Geopolitical 
contexts [54,55]. Specific examples here illustrate the point that 
Complexity Science approaches can add significant value, reflected by 
unique explanations or predictions, when considering Military Science 
[49,56], counterinsurgency approaches [57,58], and team formation 
approaches. 
Complexity Science has been used to help model and characterize the 
behavior and structure of insurgencies and terrorist organizations. As 
noted by Maxfield and others, the results of these analyses provide 
utility in understanding their nature [53]. Work has been done to model 
insurgencies and terrorist organizations as complex adaptive systems, 
revealing evolutionary tendencies already modeled in natural and 
computational systems [38,59]. Beyond terrorist groups, Complexity

10    The Great Preset 
 
Science has been used to model domestic military forces as well, such 
as interpreting frigate crews, littoral (coastal) forces, and air forces as 
complex adaptive systems [60–62].  
Across different types of military forces, the manifested collective 
behavior or “phenotype” of a group arises emergently from the 
interaction between the guiding principles of the group and the 
specifics of the environmental context. The variable expression of 
underlying characteristics of terrorist groups provides them with 
adaptive flexibility across environmental context. In order to help 
predict surfaces of attack and tactics, strategists must identify both 
essential characteristics of a group and relevant elements of the 
environment. For example, terrorist groups with similar characteristics 
are more likely to engage in frequent violence in regions which have 
higher press access [63]. Here there are striking parallels to the findings 
and implications in the literature on genetics and epigenetics [64–67]. 
This “epigenetic” spread of insurgencies thus may be modeled as 
following principles found in collective behavior models [68,69], 
resulting in patterns of spread and behavior that look remarkably 
similar to the results of ant-colony optimization algorithms [70–73]. 
Decentralized terrorist groups appear to have self-organizing and 
autopoietic (self-meaning-generating [74,75]) characteristics. These 
attributes are especially apparent in recruiting spaces, littoral 
environments, and volatile battlefield situations [5]. Where leadership 
of terrorist groups is highly centralized, surgical removal of the central 
leadership may result in the collapse of the organization. For example, 
the offer of an amnesty deal to the leaders of Al Aqsa by the Israeli 
Government caused a nearly immediate, systemic collapse of the 
organization [63]. In contrast, destroying the central leadership of a 
primarily decentralized organization may just result in loss of cohesion, 
fracture, and increased complexity, causing the group to fracture along 
hidden ideological or methodological lines just as easily as they might 
fracture on a basis of geography [63,76,77]. Separation from intellectual 
or political leadership can result in groups over-imitating their parent 
organizations, resembling well-studied social and psychological 

---PAGE BREAK---
Emergent Teams for Complex Threats    11 
 
phenomena such as cargo cults and over-imitation, leading to senseless 
violence increasingly detached from the original objectives [63,76,78–
80]. Understanding the autopoietic and self-organizing nature of these 
groups prevents a false sense of security which can so often come from 
material victories, such as the breaking of a stronghold or the 
assassination of leaders [77], as fractured groups or groups which 
remain operational despite fractured leadership or the completion of 
the explicit goals they were formed with are not uncommon. For 
example the Stern Gang (LEHI) remained active after the creation of 
the state of Israel, as did the IRA after the establishment of the Irish 
Free State, and the Ku Klux Klan in the United States after leadership 
left the organization [63]. 
Future work in the spirit of Complexity Science could elaborate and 
formalize the intersection of well-modeled natural phenomena 
(epigenetics, collective behavior), modern computational techniques 
(network analysis, machine learning) and counterinsurgency efforts. 
Such a cross-sector framework for understanding behaviors may lead 
to the ability to influence outcomes (e.g. through the use of control 
theoretic approaches) and eventually even the ability to design 
distributed counterinsurgency systems [6,81,82]. We hold that 
Complexity Science can thus provide useful direction to those who 
hold responsibility for operations and force design to be mindful of the 
complexity of the operating environment [53,61,83]. We now turn to 
an investigation of rapid team assembly in located, remote, and hybrid 
contexts, from the perspective of Complexity. 
Emergent Teams and Rapid Reorganization 
Within various civilian domains, some of which overlap with military, 
High-Reliability Organizations (HRO) have to contend with Complex 
Threat Surfaces as well [84,85]. These domains include air traffic 
control, power grid management, wildland firefighting, and intensive 
care units [84,86,87]. Similar to their military counterparts, these 
domains are often areas where failures cascade and victories 
accumulate, where small errors can create macro-level impacts that are 

---PAGE BREAK---
12    The Great Preset 
 
not necessarily proportionate to the perceived severity of the error 
viewed in isolation [88–90]. In these environments where minimizing 
chance of failure is key, optimization can be interpreted to come at the 
cost of fragility [91]. As a consequence of the importance of reliably 
managing Complex Threat Surfaces, a robust literature exists on these 
environments [85]. Work from a Complexity perspective on collective 
behavioral algorithms highlights the relevance of ecological factors 
such as degree and type of variability, and threat of catastrophic 
disruption [48,92,93]. 
While most early work on strategies within HROs focuses on co-
located groups, HRO research has adapted over the years to include 
remote and hybrid paradigms. Work has been done to integrate remote 
organizational components and even nonhuman or unmanned assets 
into HRO frameworks [94–96]. In a modern information workspace 
and battlefield, AI-augmented human actors, and autonomous AI 
systems, play an increasingly important role. A key strategy found in 
the analysis of HROs and related work on emergency response is the 
maintenance of organizational fluidity or the ability to rapidly pool 
collective expertise, share information, and reorganize in order to 
respond to emergent problems in the operating environment 
[43,85,96,97]. In oil and gas production, flexible, horizontal 
mechanisms are used to rapidly reorganize and integrate operators and 
supervisors into “tiger teams”, groups of experts that are assigned to 
solve specific problems relevant to the background of personnel [96]. 
In the auto-manufacturer Toyota, “swift market analysis response 
teams” (SMART) were organized around customer complaint content 
based on background relevance and reorganized on completion to 
greatly increase turnover on errors and handle recalls safely, this was 
successful to such an extent that elements of the role reorganization 
process were built into SCRUM, a widely used project management 
framework [85]. It is important to note that in both cases personnel 
were not required to be co-located in order to participate [85,96]. This 
transition toward more distributed frameworks aligns research on 
civilian HROs with research on complex adaptive systems, the 
challenges militaries face, and potential best practice. These same 

---PAGE BREAK---
Emergent Teams for Complex Threats    13 
 
attributes of organizational fluidity and flexibility are echoed in military 
literature on 
force 
design, 
counterterrorism, 
doctrine, 
and 
counterinsurgency as well [60,62]. 
In respect to force design, organizational fluidity has been 
acknowledged as essential in modern militaries. Special attention has 
been paid to littoral warfare, where land, water, and amphibious forces 
are faced with the paradox of maintaining flexibility while being 
composed of assets which are the result of decades-long investment 
cycles [60,98]. Modern littoral environments are often characterized by 
the myriad of Complex Threat Surfaces that can be exploited by local 
insurgencies and related groups. These Complex Threat Surfaces 
include the surface of the water itself in the form of mines, unmanned 
vehicles, and submerged vessels, as well as attacks from the air via 
drones [62,99]. 
To this end, it is difficult to design a perfect system to ensure that any 
specific vessel, given any single configuration of crew and equipment, 
would be capable of deterring every threat [60,98,100,101]. As 
described in a Complexity-informed analysis of rapidly-assembling 
teams on frigate ships, “it is not reasonable to expect a linear response 
as circumstances will dictate specific actions”—in such cases, operators 
on the ship operate semi-autonomously and teams emerge in response 
to threat assessments [60,62]. For such situations, pre-planned 
responses help maneuver the crew into positions from which they can 
confidently follow or diverge from doctrine. This ability to rapidly 
reorganize is especially important given terror and insurgent groups’ 
tendency toward mimetic transfer and copy-cat attacks, trading and 
adapting strategies that worked for other groups [99]. Organizations in 
this space have had notable successes in the exploitation of Complex 
Threat Surfaces present when military and civilian ships operate in 
littoral environments [8,99]. In response to these dangers are projects 
like STANFLEX, which is a modular ship design implemented by the 
Danish Navy, offering the capability of hot-swapping modular 
weapons, sensor, and staging platforms while in port in order to rapidly 
reorganize equipment and crew configurations [60,102]. 

---PAGE BREAK---
14    The Great Preset 
 
Rapid Reorganization of leadership in counterinsurgency efforts has 
been documented to be impactful. The Malayan Emergency (Malay 
Peninsula, 1948-1960) is frequently looked to as a subject for case 
studies of successful counterinsurgencies [103,104] and will be 
discussed briefly. Though the counterinsurgency had many failures at 
the beginning, there was a reorganization of top leadership to include 
civilians. This structure, once allowed to proceed, quickly replicated at 
provincial and district levels resulting in a decentralization of 
intelligence and local operations [104]. With increased information 
sharing and the inclusion of locals, less focus was given to combatting 
the rebels and organizations took significant steps to begin addressing 
the social, economic, and political problems which drove rebel support 
instead [103–105]. These emergent, cohesive civilian and military 
management apparatuses robbed rebels of public support and 
contributed significantly to the war effort at remarkably low costs [105]. 
This style of reorganization and rapid assembly of organizations or 
teams with the inclusion of populations in the area of operations was 
replicated in Iraq in 2003 and was viewed as imperative to operations 
in the region, especially due to the complexity of the operating 
environment [96,106–108]. 
New York Landmarks Plot 1993 
To close, as well as provide an optimistic contrast with the Mumbai 
events, we relate a vignette from 1993, when a group of terrorists 
affiliated with Al Qaeda planned to put into action a multistage attack 
to exploit Complex Threat Surfaces across the island of Manhattan in 
New York City [3,109]. The terrorists intended to storm the island in 
watercraft [8] and split into several tactical teams. The group’s plan 
included bombs at key locations like landmarks and transport 
infrastructure such as the Lincoln and Holland tunnels and the ferries 
in lower Manhattan. Simultaneously, other teams intended to raid 
hotels such as the Waldorf-Astoria, St. Regis, and U.N. Plaza with the 
intention of finding high-value targets and inflicting as much damage 
to soft-targets as possible [8,109]. Similar to the pre-planning in 
Mumbai, the group in New York did on-site reconnaissance in 

---PAGE BREAK---
Emergent Teams for Complex Threats    15 
 
advance, taking detailed notes of stairwells, cameras, and security 
personnel location and attire [8]. The FBI, upon discovery of the plot, 
began to coordinate multiple, previously-unconnected individuals, 
such as controlled informants from previous operations, terrorism task 
forces, and local government and police. With this reorganization in 
place, it was decided that they would allow the group to centralize their 
operation in relative safety in order to prevent fracture. When the 
group began building explosives, their safe house was raided, eight 
arrests were made, and the plot was foiled with no loss of life [109]. 
This New York vignette, contrasted with the eerily similar Attack on 
Mumbai, illustrates how rapid reorganization and assembly of teams in 
response to novel, emergent threats can meaningfully impact outcomes 
in counterinsurgency operations. 
Conclusion 
In this paper we have used the interdisciplinary approach of 
Complexity Science to introduce and highlight Complex Threat 
Surfaces as a key variable for counterinsurgency efforts and other gray 
zone efforts in today’s cyberphysical battlefield. We highlighted key 
principles that differentiated event outcomes, such as the ability of 
opposing forces to rapidly reorganize, propagate information, and 
reassemble teams. As teams in the modern operating environment 
become increasingly remote, new challenges are presented, but also 
new advantages can become realized [96]. The definition and 
identification of Complex Threat Surfaces highlights the need for 
further work at the intersection of information sharing system design 
[97], decentralized intelligence or OSINT [108,110], and other topics. 
Conceptual models and innovation technologies arising from this 
integrative approach may prove useful in service of counterinsurgency 
efforts now and in the future.

18    The Great Preset 
 
Introduction 
Disturbing and destabilizing online narratives can be described as 
complex threat surfaces that have the potential to impact the entire 
world. Quite simply, the “Internet is real life”, cybercrime, peer-to-peer 
abuse via social media, and sophisticated propaganda have real-world 
implications. To grasp the heterogeneity and incompatibility of online 
narratives available today, we can consider the user experience of a 
web-searcher with an honest inquiry into the biological basis and 
origins of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus associated with the disease of 
COVID-19 [1]). Depending on which search terms are used, media are 
followed, or friends are asked, this seeker might conclude that the 
origins and spread of SARS-CoV-2 were due to some wild animal [2,3], 
natural genomic mutations [4,5] (or not [6,7]), the spread of millimeter-
wave “5G” technology [8–10], long-running vaccine research programs 
funded by Bill Gates-related international organizations [11,12], or 
Bioterrorism from China, the USA, or some non-State actors [13]. 
Disinformation and “fake news” aside, the ability to make sense of 
legitimate information streams online has become untenable. 
Where in the past, organizations tasked with knowledge management 
and sensemaking often had the problem of getting data and analyses, 
now the problem is parsing it. Novel online-native frameworks (with 
theoretical models and deliverable tools) are required to deal with this 
complex situation [14]. Here we use “meme” and “narrative” 
interchangeably to refer to a broad set of cultural products that 
“influencers” or “content creators” might make, that includes the 
image templates that fit the popular cultural definitions of a "meme" as 
well as videos, songs, hashtags, copypasta 1, songs, stories, posts, pages, 
themes, and styles that also act as vehicles for the transmission of 
narrative. These viral videos and movements can contribute to the 
failure of states and institutions, and such directions can be expected 
to increase in frequency in the near future. Large and legacy institutions

find themselves challenged in the modern narrative ecosystem, in part 
due to the novel non-linear dynamics of global techno-memetics and 
narratives. The modern memetic ecosystem calls for unconventional, 
non-linear, and online-native strategies [15–19]. 
The human memory system is characterized by its ability to self-
organize and reorganize, allowing for spontaneous expertise, even 
when dealing with novel phenomena [20]. This capability allows 
humans to succeed in grasping extant and emergent links between 
memetic materials that might be entirely missed by Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) [21]. The reason for this is that even when documents 
and memetic objects are fully indexed by an ideal and complete data 
architecture, it can be difficult for AI to understand content and impute 
context, let alone recommend effective interventions. It is challenging 
to design a “perfect AI'' to stop such objects in the public space, as it 
is a game of whack-a-mole that often has collateral damage (for 
example, Twitter’s attempts at fact-checking) [22,23]. In areas of 
national security, public health information, and questions of social 
justice, unintentional consequences of AI-based curation can be 
devastating [24,25]. Fundamentally, this arises because modern AI 
systems are having trouble detecting links between memetic material, 
other datasets (big data), the metadata (big metadata), and causal 
models of the world (big mechanisms) [26,27]. The reason why we 
need curated knowledge networks rather than co-occurrence matrices 
here, is analogous to why we need curated path discovery (via 
Geocaching, Ingress, Niantic) rather than just total movement data. 
With the information ecosystem in this current condition, we ask: what 
directions for platform design and Remote Team research might be 
beneficial? 
Instantaneous Remote Teams 
Culture production and agenda-setting are effective, and even magical, 
within communities composed of small teams (e.g. music scenes made 
of multiple bands, academic disciplines composed of labs, book 

---PAGE BREAK---
20    The Great Preset 
 
subcultures reflected by separate reading groups). Communities of 
small teams are the “last mile” of culture production and consumption. 
Nowadays, such teams and communities are increasingly all-online or 
online-native. We refer to online-native teams as Remote Teams, 
whatever their form or function. In cases where Remote Team 
formation is rapid or instantaneous (as opposed to Remote Teams with 
low turnover), we introduce the term Instantaneous Remote Teams 
(IRT). Instantaneous Remote Teams (IRT) are essential for function, 
adaptability, and resilience in conventional as well as non-conventional 
institutions [33]. 
Collective attitudinal states and beliefs can propagate themselves 
through time during Fiction generation, role-playing, and other kinds 
of Games [34,35]. Examples of this mode of narrative creation can be 
found in moderated and unmoderated role-playing games [36–39]. 
Games can be used as a device for therapy and serve as a basis for 
abstract task transfer in and out of game. Games can affect users off 
the platform in very real ways (weight loss, psychology, voting). 
Generative games (e.g. Minecraft, D&D) are often played via placing 
individuals in a (cyber) environment with tools, threats, and constraints 
and can result in creative or practical collaboration and organization 
even when there are no obvious directions or objectives given to the 
participants. Collaborative Games can lead to a playful and flexible 
view of the self, team, and world.

participants. Collaborative Games can lead to a playful and flexible 
view of the self, team, and world. 
The many iterations of the popular Massively multiplayer online role-
playing game (MMORPG) World of Warcraft (WoW) offer an 
instructive case study in IRTs. While much of the game can be played 
alone, the most valuable rewards WoW has to offer its players requires 
the coordination of IRTs composed of both familiar actors and 
strangers. When a group of players commit a scenario in which 
adversaries are generated by the Game’s environment (“PvE Content” 
reflected by antagonistic Non-Player Characters), players rapidly 
assemble teams composed of 5, 10, 20, or 40 individuals capable of 
both distinct and overlapping roles. These IRTs are tasked with 
complex challenges which cannot be done alone. These group goals 
cannot be completed without cooperation, communication, and trust 
[40]. The temporary and task-focused nature of these PvE teams meets 
criteria for rapid cultural transmission [15,41]. Where players 
committing to “PvE content” rapidly assemble teams prior to engaging 
with tasks, players engaging with “PvP content”, or content in which 
adversaries are other players, may become a member of an IRT as a 
consequence of being in the proximity of other players (formation 
around shared mutual threat). The outcome of such IRT vs. IRT 
encounters will be influenced by the capabilities, strategy, mission and 
understanding of the situation by each IRT [42]. In both PvE and PvP 
engagements, rapid cultural transmission occurs through conversation 
and call-outs of bad behavior. Over hundreds of iterations, guilds and 
communities of WoW players learn not only tactics, strategy, in-game 
lore, and jargon but also narrative, transferable skills, and a sense of 
identity. These players are receiving gradual initiation into the moral 
order and praxis of a Game, despite a clear lack of distinct curriculum 
or even a consistent cast of characters [43]. 
Research and experience converge on several themes that recur in IRTs 
from the classroom to the operating theater to the aircraft carrier. Here 
we highlight several common features or best practices of IRTs that 
are relevant here. Resilient IRTs are able to rapidly find emergent best 

---PAGE BREAK---
22    The Great Preset 
 
practices (e.g. customized solutions that are reached via improvisation). 
IRTs benefit from cultural competencies, transferable skills, and 
effective communication protocols. In many cases, the most rapid 
form of communication is shared mindset (instantaneous coordinated 
action via independent response to stimuli). High-functioning IRTs 
draw from a community of culturally-competent, pre-adapted, flexible 
agents. Increasingly not just humans are involved in IRTs—in online 
settings, augmented and artificial agents are common. The study and 
practice of IRTs can involve both qualitative & quantitative 
approaches, so diverse team perspectives and transdisciplinary 
approaches are crucial for maximal impact [30,44]. 
Communities of IRTs, almost as a rule, cannot escape disintegration 
by “returning to the good ol’ days”, nor by utopianism alone. Rather, 
community disintegration is averted when novel approaches to IRT 
reassembly and renewal are implemented [39]. The Hero’s Journey is a 
common model of Self-renewal used both in product user experience 
as well as game design [45,46]. Similar renewal processes can be seen 
in other complex systems such as cultures, insect colonies, and 
economies [47–49]. Individuals, IRTs, and communities may find 
paradigms of renewal to be of special importance during moments of 
uncertainty and rapid change. 
Infinite Games in the Gray Zone 
Infinite Games are those that have no distinct end state, and have the 
potential to be played forever, by the same or a rotating cast of actors. 
Infinite Games have many possible outcomes, an air of possibility, and 
a balance of tradition and novelty. The term “Infinite Game” has been 
used by Simon Sinek to describe the modern paradigm of management 
and leadership [50]: open-ended, endlessly-challenging, and more like 
a marathon than a sprint. Sinek highlights that Infinite Games succeed 
when the team has a just cause, a worthy adversary, a vulnerable team, 
courageous leadership, and an open playbook [51]. Albeit with slightly 
different terminology, Biology has long focused on “Infinite Games” 
in nature, such as Red Queen coevolution and winnerless competitions 

---PAGE BREAK---
Infinite Games for Infinite Teams    23 
 
(Evolution can be seen as the “Transfinite Game” in that it is open-
ended regarding how open-ended it is [52–54].). Infinite Games are 
also a useful framework for considering other innovation spaces such 
as culture creation, agenda-setting, research & design, improvisation, 
LARPing 2, SciFi, etc. 
“Infinite Teams” are the organizational analog to Infinite Games, 
teams which have open-ended and evolving composition. The 
turnover rate of Infinite Teams can be rapid (e.g. improv games, IRT’s), 
or slow (Academia, Church). The process by which Infinite Teams 
evolve are system-specific (e.g. a rapidly-assembling World of Warcraft 
team vs. a slowly-changing corporate bureaucracy). To convey the 
space where Infinite Teams play Infinite Games, we use the gestalt 
term “Gray Zone”, to capture the ambiguity, uncertainty, stochasticity, 
and chaos in the blur between formally defined domains. To survive 
the growing influence of Gray Zone activities, communities and 
governments in 2020 need to be adaptive, flexible, and responsive at 
both local and global scales. 
Infinite Games can be, and often must be, played in the Gray Zone. 
Infinite Games, like life itself, may or may not feature ambiguous goals, 
partially-understood scenarios, and emotional engagement. While the 
aforementioned Infinite Games refer to games with a Game Theoretic 
tone, such as evolution and management practice, what would be 
traditionally defined as games are still valuable to consider. Games (e.g. 
board games, video games) have demonstrable value in facilitating 
users in the learning of history, soft skills, and technical ability [55–59]. 
As stated earlier, “The Internet is Real Life”—all games have the 
potential to have real world impact. In many cases they present very 
real opportunities for citizens of various backgrounds to contribute 
directly or indirectly to society and science [60].

---PAGE BREAK---
24    The Great Preset 
 
Infinite Games, like the world as seen from the CAS perspective, are 
fundamentally transdisciplinary [61,62]. This is because when Games 
(or conversations and research paradigms) are Infinite, there is no final 
limit to the type of topics that enter the fray. Few theoretical or applied 
studies have considered the unique improvisational dynamics of 
“Infinite Games for Infinite Teams”. Work in this area could draw 
from fields as disparate as wearable neurofeedback devices [63,64], 
video game strategy [65], and military science [33,66,67]. Perhaps in the 
future, Infinite Games designed to impact the world could draw the 
large player-bases that Eve Online or World of Warcraft have, and be 
designed to facilitate solutions to emergent problems which require 
crowd-effort or rapid cultural transmission. 
Two Visions of Infinite Games for Infinite 
Teams 
Polyplexus, a research acceleration platform developed in part by 
DARPA 3, uses game like approaches to cataloging scientific claims and 
concepts, and could be an inspiration for a platform for Infinite Games 
of all kinds, or evolve to be such a platform itself (culture creation, 
narrative evolution, research & development, etc.). Here we build off 
of previous collective and improvisational approaches such as Cadavre 
Exquis, LARPing [68,69], and PPPiP 4 [62]. While most historical work 
on the improvisational dynamics of culture production by in-person 
teams, much of the work transfers naturally to IRTs. Here we will 
explore how a Polyplexus-like platform might be able to host Infinite 
Games for Infinite Teams. These two independent visions stem from 
the intersection of culture creation (“memestreams”) and online-native 
Instantaneous Remote Teams (“teamstreams”).

Idea 1. Formal Memetics (e.g. ontology, controlled 
vocabulary, systematics, pipelines, taxonomies for memes and 
narratives). 
A Formal-Informal interface allows for the co-evolution of 
narrative and formal aspects of a SciFi story through the use 
of an API/metadata/ontology/structure, A Polyplexus-
specific format could be used, or it could be more general 
[70,71]). The more technically-minded people on the 
platform can focus on the formal yet also creative aspects of 
"world building"—not by writing in art/captions/prose, but 
by proposing values for parameters about the world, culture, 
or individual in the narrative (i.e. "Planet $planet.name orbits 
$sun.name, so the temperature there changes there according 
to the Temperature(space, time) distribution annually, leading 
to 
a 
social 
regime 
phase 
space 
described 
by 
Government(space, time) dynamics"). 
Prose-, caption-, sound-, and art-oriented participants on the 
platform can co-evolve narratives along with this 
programmatic specification of the world/culture/individual. 
There is a Division of cognitive labor in the co-construction 
of the total world model. This formal-informal hybrid 
approach to world building also allows the introduction of 
"story seeds" or constraints/opportunities for the world, for 
individuals to explore within. Also this approach allows 
hierarchical recognition of stories yet unwritten, perspectives 
yet untold. It is a collective distributed learning process, by 
teams who evolve their composition, knowledge, and skills. 
By setting rules for contribution, such as those found in 
world-building games like Microscope, the construction of 
world-narratives of fictional societies faced with constraints 
and boons can be paired with the assignment of historical 
examples and scientific principles may have the potential to 
yield discovery and analyses of potential threats to real world

societies [36]. Real-world, fictional, and simulated worlds and 
memes can be compared and contrasted through 
“phylomemomic” approaches drawn from evolutionary 
biology. 
Idea 2. A case-management-like system for knowledge 
mapping, enabling a cooperative “Cadavre Exquis” role-
playing game played by Infinite Teams. 
There are three roles in this Infinite Game: Red, Green, 
Blue. 
• Red proposes “sword” memes 
• Blue proposes “shield” memes 
• Green integrates sword & shield memes into 
communicable (deliverable, coherent, structured, 
comprehensible, accessible, enjoyable, meaningful) 
narratives or paths. 
Where Red and Blue focus on evidence and logic (logos, 
ethos, authority), Green focuses on evocation of emotion, 
anecdotes, and narrative (pathos and ethos, appeals and 
authority). Green introduces kairos in the system, that is an 
understanding, sense, and sequence to the memes in a space. 
The Green role might also be able to eventually access in-field 
or Mechanical Turk-like experiments to test the relative 
efficacy of different approaches. 
One or many individuals are assigned to each role. Individuals 
are all roles then enact a “checks & balances”-type Infinite 
Game, related to some scenario or seed idea. It is a 
decentralized Hegelian Memetics, an Internet-native Glass 
Bead Game, an endless conversation that is waiting for your 
input. People who are familiar with the Game could generate 
authentic and just-in-time modifications to the game, as well 
as supplements, variants, and subcultures.

Teams are composed of stable or rotating casts of individuals 
acting under different identities. A user can create any 
number of identities. These identities are characters with 
some background, field, political leaning, subject matter of 
projects, titles, callsign, and a set of symbols to use in lieu of 
an avatar. Users agree to make great effort to approach 
subject matter in a way that is appropriate to this identity. A 
user can sign into any identity they wish and enter a 
“workspace”. A “Workspace” is a saved “project” of sorts. A 
new workspace is initialized with a “Seed-Meme”. This might 
be the central argument of a paper they are writing or a 
hypothesis they are trying to investigate. For example, 
“Chimpanzees may evolve to use tools” or “AI can be used 
to detect hate speech”. Once a Seed-meme is chosen (along 
with the constraints of the space), it becomes the “meme in 
focus”. The goal of the Game is then to participate in a 
process of memestreaming / weltanschauung / argument 
narrative co-evolution. Primary perspectives and supporting 
material can be added by players, and extant information can 
be linked, mutated, contextualized, refuted, supported, 
communicated, and subjected to feedback loops. Roles can 
be rotated among players, augmented via AI systems, and 
even filled by AI. Players can switch between two modes: 
• In Explore mode, all team members can see all 
information, to maximally catalyze research and 
collaboration. 
• In Exploit mode, each team member is assigned to 
only one role. This encourages them to embody the 
role entirely, and to play whole-heartedly.

Discussion 
Hermann Hesse, in his 1943 book The Glass Bead Game (Das 
Glasperlenspiel), characterized a dismal “Age of the Feuilleton”, one 
in which “the life of the mind [was like] a degenerate plant which was 
squandering its strength in excessive vegetative growth”. In the book, 
the unhealthy mental experiences characteristic to the “Age of the 
Feuilleton” were inflamed by a media ecosystem of “scandal” 5 and 
“passive” infotainment 6. Today in 2020, we find ourselves in an 
Internet-based “Age of the Feuilleton”, full of (in modern terms) 
disinfo, conspiracies, psyops, fake news, echo chambers, funnels, and 
silos. Rather than the fanciful terminology of Feuilleton, we might refer 
to this scenario as the Gray Zone in 4th generational warfare [72,73] 
and find the potential for prevention of negative impacts in 
information and cognitive security [74,75]. 
In Hesse’s work as in our current world, the path out of an “Age of the 
Feuilleton” is challenging, though not all is lost. In the grand tapestry 
that is human history, the recognition of the depths of an “Age of the 
Feuilleton” is also the spark, the seed, the impetus of something new. 
Hesse wrote that the recognition of an “Age of the Feuilleton” 
occurred at the moment when a society was “...already on the verge of 
 
5 “If the bearer of an aristocratic name was involved in a scandal, the readers of many 
thousands of feature articles at once learned the facts. What is more, on that same 
day or by the next day at the latest they received an additional dose of anecdotal, 
historical, psychological, erotic, and other stuff on the catchword of the moment. A 
torrent of zealous scribbling poured out over every ephemeral incident, and in quality, 
assortment, and phraseology all this material bore the mark of mass goods rapidly 
and irresponsibly turned out.” 
6 “In those days the citizen of a medium-sized town or his wife could at least once a 
week (in big cities pretty much every night) attend lectures offering theoretical 
instruction on some subject or other: on works of art, poets, scholars, researchers, 
world tours. The members of the audience at these lectures remained purely 
passive… People heard lectures on writers whose works they had never read and 
never meant to, sometimes accompanied by pictures projected on a screen. At these 
lectures, as in the feature articles in the newspapers, they struggled through a deluge 
of isolated cultural facts and fragments of knowledge robbed of all meaning.”

that dreadful devaluation of the Word...”. In the Glass Bead Game, 
what eventually leads to the visionary place of Castalia, is when “at first 
in secret and within the narrowest circles, that ascetically heroic 
countermovement [began] to flow visibly and powerfully, and ushered 
in the new self-discipline and dignity of the human intellect”. Perhaps 
our current Age of the Feuilleton could be collectively ameliorated by 
global Infinite Teams, playing Infinite Games for the benefit of all.

Active Inference  
& Behavior Engineering  
for Teams

ABSTRACT 
Comprehensive frameworks for Teams should include various 
functionalities and structures in order to capture the broad range of 
affordances available for modern Remote Teams, including, but not 
limited to, synchronous & asynchronous communications, memes, 
geospatial maps, hardware/software use, and contact escalation. We 
suggest that Systems Engineering provides guidelines to define the 
functions of Ontologies, Narratives, Formal documents, and Tools 
(ONFT) within the context of the life cycle of any System of Interest. 
Following this ONFT assessment it is possible to break out to sub-
systems levels and mechanistic analysis. In this paper we explore how 
a new generation of ONFT for Remote Teams could be based on 
Active Inference, a process theory related to the Free Energy Principle. 
Effective ONFT based upon Active Inference could lead to the 
realization of lightweight and powerful epistemic tools to guide 
everyday decision-making in an embodied, enactive fashion. Such a 
technology for Remote Teams would lead to fundamental changes in 
various aspects of Team function, for example the efficiency of a 
Team’s production of artifacts or self-reported “phenomenology of the 
working day”.

CONTRIBUTIONS 
• 
Communication is fundamental in natural and designed teams; 
effective communication systems are needed to facilitate the 
organization and function of complex multi-agent systems. 
• 
Alignment on Mission, Narrative, and Ontology is tied to team 
performance. 
• 
Under the Free Energy Principle (FEP), previous work has 
synthesized Active Inference (ActInf) with domains such as 
Narratives [1], Ontologies [2] and extended cognition in multiscale 
biological systems [3,4]. 
• 
Using the ActInf framework, here we explore various kinds of 
Communication in located teams and all-online Remote Teams 
(RT).  
• 
Online work and RT are promising systems for theoretical study and 
direct applications of the ActInf framework, because all states and 
updates in digital systems are observable. 
• 
Here we bring the FEP-ActInf-Narrative nexus together with the 
applied approach of Systems Engineering (SE), to begin the work of 
formalizing the processes of RT formation and lifecycle 
management. 
 
DRIVING & INSPIRING QUESTIONS 
• 
How could we consider the coherence, narrative, and identity 
function of communication at the individual scale, as well as the 
scale of Teams & organizations? 
• 
What kinds of methods for Teams (analytics, user interfaces, etc) 
could be deployed to address basic and applied questions of interest?  
• 
How could we apply multi-scale Active Inference frameworks to 
Systems approaches such as Ontologies, Narratives, Formal 
documents, and Tools (ONFT)? 
• 
How could we address concepts and models for epistemic values 
within the context of ONFT for Remote Teams (epistemic 
foraging)? 

---PAGE BREAK---

• 
How could Teams ensure narrative reliability? How can the 
epistemic and goal-oriented ends of foraging be jointly optimized by 
individuals and teams?  
• 
What we could take from concepts and works on niche construction 
to aid development of ONFT approaches for modern, global 
Teams? 
• 
Could we define approaches for personal behavior engineering by 
using ONFT in Teams communication? 
Teams are about Function & Communication 
Work is performed by teams, human and non-human (e.g. ants) [5–7]. 
The concept of Division of Labor describes how system subunits 
interact with each other and perform work [7,8] in Complex Adaptive 
Systems regulated by agent-agent and agent-environment feedback 
systems [7,9–11] (also see Task Allocation [12,13], Heterarchy [14–16], 
and ant semiotics [6,17,18]). In the context of remote and located 
Teams, heterarchical subsets of members and stakeholders allocate 
tasks based on practices (norms) and Roles (identities or assignments). 
Team members not only perform work, but they also send signals, 
exchange results, and contribute to shared and documented models in 
extended cognitive tools [19,20]. Tools can help both long-lasting and 
rapidly-assembling Teams deal with challenges which can’t be solved 
or resolved by any single person. For example, good Team 
documentation software enables efficient usage of distributed expertise 
& transdisciplinary cognition by allowing the affordance of interacting 
with the wisdom of previous teammates [21,22]. 
For humans, narratives are aspects of individual and shared generative 
models of the world [23]. For teams, multi-scale narratives emerge as 
individuals build a generative model of their team. We highlight the 
phenomenological experience of an individual worker as they 
investigate high level narratives (Why does this company exist? What 
problems is it solving or impacting in the world?) as well as team-level 
narratives (Why does this team exist? Why is our part of the project 
important to the whole company?). Narratives become memetic when

they can be shared and understood in common, this process of 
communication leads to alignment based upon shared values and 
mission. 
Modern Teams are Remote Teams 
There is a need to define Team communication in a more formal 
fashion, ideally drawing on insights from transdisciplinary theoretical 
(e.g. Complexity Science) and applied (e.g. Systems Engineering, 
Systems Innovation) approaches [24,25]. Modern Teams are composed 
of sets of human, collective, or non-human agents [26–29], often with 
high turnover rate (see Definitions) [21,30,31]. Today’s Remote Teams 
(RT) are physically distributed, and increasingly use the internet to 
coordinate action and informationally connect team members 
[24,32,33]. When working with Instantaneous Remote Teams (IRTs), 
one also needs to consider the timing at a very fine scale – in IRTs, 
each team member could participate in different Teams in different 
capacities during one working day or even a single hour [31]. 
High Reliability Organizations (HROs) are organizations that contend 
with volatile environments in which many interactions can be 
considered non-routine. HROs are increasingly reliant on small, 
physically distributed, and sometimes temporary or rapidly assembled 
teams as a means of solving novel, complex problems [34–37]. 
Examples of these Teams include “tiger teams” in the oil and gas 
industry [34], and “swift market analysis response teams” (SMART) in 
the auto industry. Key rituals, protocols, and strategies for these IRTs 
have been incorporated into SCRUM and Agile Development 
frameworks for rapid development of software as well [37]. The rapidly 
assembled, or sometimes “instantaneous” remote team, is an emergent 
solution to a set of emergent problems. Human knowledge has 
expanded exponentially, consequently, fields of expertise began to 
divide into specializations as a basis to reduce time-to-application and 
learning requirements [38]. This sub-specialization has achieved its 
goals at a cost: generally, no single individual and often no single team 
holds all of the knowledge and skills necessary to solve the novel 

---PAGE BREAK---
ActInf & Behavior Engineering for Teams    39 
 
problems emerging from the complex threat surfaces with which 
HROs contend, and as a result, reconfiguration is becoming a more 
normalized response [25,39,40]. This solution isn’t unique to industry: 
National Navies are organizations which contend with complex threat 
surfaces in littoral environments, with the additional constraint that 
equipment repertoires are the product of decade-long investment 
cycles [25,41,42]. Consequently, many National Navies have converged 
on the same outlook: that no single team or equipment configuration 
is adequate for the future of expeditionary warfare and indeed remote 
work [41–43]. 
Where emergent teams of any type are created in response to novel, 
complex problems, they cannot rely on effective informational 
compression via inflexible protocols, as the team situation and even 
composition may be a moving target. Rapidly-forming teams 
sometimes are precluded from relying on compression via long-term 
bonding as would be found in traditional high performance teams. As 
such, it should be unsurprising that high performance, emergent teams 
responding to novel, complex problems generally rely on shared 
organizational culture, mission, and narrative [25,31,37,44–49]. In the 
context of both internet communities & in-person protests, memes can 
serve as rallying points as well as symbols that communicate mission-
critical narrative information to team members 
[25,31,50]. 
Organizational culture in remote and located teams can be defined as 
the shared beliefs and values of an organization, as well as its collective 
processes, cognitive and physical [51–53]. Mission has three primary 
connotations: military [54,55], religious [56,57], and corporate [58,59]. 
In all three usages of “mission”, mission-relevant narratives and 
symbolic (or even esoteric) communication are used for the purpose 
of compressed goal-setting. 
In the context of team communication, narratives are dynamic, and in 
constant adjustment [38,60,61]. Narratives become recognizable 
through shared or attuned semiotics, iconology, and totemization 
[47,62–66]. Narratives can be created, perturbed, and managed [63] 
through the production of physical artifacts [67] as well as through 

---PAGE BREAK---
40    The Great Preset 
 
ritual [68–70]. Narratives are a form of memetic compression, for 
example Linn’s reduction of three centuries of American military 
philosophy into three “camps”: Guardians, Heroes, and Managers [71]. 
This concept of “narrative as dynamical analogy” is about finding the 
stable mappings within complex systems that allow for effective action, 
as is sometimes used in physics [72], computer science [73], and in 
memetics itself [74,75]. 
Rapidly formed teams and IRTs come together with clear limitations, 
the most important of which is the social cohesion and trust necessary 
for organizational sensemaking. Effective formation of small teams 
leads to optimal utilization of collective intelligence, and generally 
positive performance [37,76–81]. Conversely, failure to develop mutual 
trust and social cohesion can hinder performance [80,82–84]. When 
opportunities for a team (startup, governmental, research, or 
otherwise) are dynamic and require rapid reorientation, failures of team 
formation can be lethal [37,51,84,85]. Teams have both implicit and 
explicit organizational structures & networks of communication. These 
defined or undefined team structures (representations of networks of 
roles, positions, signals) have direct implications for the efficacy of 
communication and production of Team artifacts (physical, software, 
narrative, memes). Functional small teams can be argued to belong 
(exclusively or non-exclusively) to at least one of three classifications 
characterized by the means by which members reduce uncertainty 
about the signals and actions of other members, presented here: 
ONTOLOGICAL ALIGNMENT 
The first kind of group is composed of organizations which 
depend on very strict, clearly defined, compressed ontologies 
paired with strict processes that limit the potential for signal-
error, creating high expectations of trust between individuals 
who do not necessarily know each other or even expect to 
interact again, such as operating rooms, or air traffic control 
[34,51,86–88].  

---PAGE BREAK---
ActInf & Behavior Engineering for Teams    41 
 
INTIMATE TRUST ALIGNMENT 
The second kind of group is found within organizations 
which depend on team bonding and practice over very long 
periods of time in order to create high-trust and “short-hand” 
communication that is very highly compressed even if 
ambiguous or indiscernible to external actors – this group 
includes organizations which create a “collective mind” 
during operations such as special operations units, fire 
departments, sports teams, aircraft carrier flight decks, and 
non-human cooperative hunting groups such as wolves 
[44,51,87,89,90].  
NARRATIVE ALIGNMENT 
The third is composed of organizations which are aligned on 
organizational culture, narrative, or mission [31,37,46,91,92]. 
These groups can be anonymous, and dynamic in 
composition or focus. 
Here, by defining Teams in terms of their communicative structure, we 
include many informal groupings (internet chat rooms, crowds, 
protests, spontaneous public meetings) not classically considered as 
Teams. Our Team definition here is oriented towards capturing the 
diversity of communicating systems, rather than just the explicit 
organizational structures. In modern contexts, teams assemble and 
disassemble over short timescales, and are often composed of not just 
of humans but also non-human facilitation agents [26–29,93]. What is 
not a team, under this conception? The short answer to this question, 
which will be explored later in the context of Team Markov Blankets, 
is that non-communicating entities, or entities that are not part of the 
same informational niche, are not part of the same team. Non-
communicating entities may still have alignment of values, mission, or 
even behavior—but they are not on the same team because they are in 
non-overlapping informational niches. All of these examples point to 
the need for a formalized system for today’s RT that can meaningfully 
cope with all of these strategic and tactical challenges.

42    The Great Preset 
 
Systems Engineering Provides Frameworks for 
Life Cycle Management of Complex Systems 
To take a field from theoretical speculation to applied utility, we need 
a set of tools for defining and interacting with a System of Interest 
(SoI). In this case we are interested in behavior engineering of team 
communication structures. Engineering is always about changing 
something in the world, and so behavior engineering in teams is no 
exception. Engineering can benefit from the Complexity Science 
perspective, but a conceptual approach alone is incomplete for the 
designing and implementing of real systems. To quote from the 
definitive Systems Engineering (SE) Book of Knowledge:  
“Systems Engineering (SE) is an interdisciplinary approach and means 
to enable the realization of successful systems. It focuses on holistically 
and concurrently understanding stakeholder needs; exploring 
opportunities; documenting requirements; and synthesizing, verifying, 
validating, and evolving solutions while considering the complete problem, 
from system concept exploration through system disposal” [94]. 
SE frameworks define usage of Division of Labor for life cycle 
management based on different functional Roles for each stage. For 
each task to be performed, Practices (e.g. architecture, development, 
testing) are supported through technologies relevant to each Role. SE 
defines “Practices” as the combination of discipline, work, products, 
tools and activities [95,96]. To provide actionable solutions to pressing 
needs, Systems Engineering defines the “functions” and objects of 
attention during work on SoI life cycle [95,96]. In SE, functions are 
also a key unit of analysis. These functions can be carried out by 
multiple humans, or one human may have multiple roles/functions. 
Thus the design imperative, within a Division of Labor context, is to 
configure the roles in order to produce functional outcomes. This 
refocuses the discussion away from spurious communication, and 
toward task-oriented or performance-oriented outcomes. The pursuit 
in SE of expected team outcomes is akin to the cybernetic idea that 

---PAGE BREAK---
ActInf & Behavior Engineering for Teams    43 
 
complex self-regulating systems must be goal-seeking in order to 
survive and thrive [97–99]. 
We draw on the OMG Essence framework [100] to explore the use of 
Alphas (Abstract-Level Progress Health Attribute), which are 
uncertainty-reducing sets of States and Checklists for that track 
changes in the performance of collective work. Teams, at any given 
moment, are focused on a single Alpha that rises to the level of group 
attentional awareness [101], akin to the emergence of high-level 
salience in hierarchical systems [4,102]. The Essence framework 
identifies seven Alphas as objects of attention in every software 
engineering project: Stakeholders, Opportunity, Requirements, 
Software System, Team, Way of Working, and Work [100]. These seven 
categories also apply well to RTs. In the course of the project the status 
of the team undergoes small and large changes, passing through states 
as work is performed. These states of teams and products are 
observable, in contrast to Alphas, the states of which we can only judge 
"by instruments"—by the state of artifacts. 
It was proposed in Systems Engineering Essence framework [95,96] to 
expand applications of Alphas from software projects only to hardware 
and sociotechnical projects by changing Requirements and Software 
System to System Definition and System Realization. To capture some 
of the useful ideas from SE, we summarized several recent summary 
documents of Systems Engineering (Table 1 & Table 2). Despite the 
fact that SE approaches well established and have been used widely in 
the last decades it is still the general opinion that SE needs to interface 
with people outside the scope of a system, even though there is no way 
to directly engineer their behavior. One possible solution to this 
challenge of integrating internal and external SoI dynamics would be 
to set patterns and rules for internal and external communication [103]. 
We now turn to the enactive framework of Active Inference to provide 
inspiration for the design of communication patterns for RT that 
would facilitate modern teamwork.

44    The Great Preset 
 
Active Inference in Teams 
Active Inference (ActInf, see Definitions) is a formal framework that 
frames goal-seeking behavior as an actor-centric dynamic feedback 
between internal and external states, mediated by sense and action 
[104–106]. ActInf is a process theory (as opposed to a state or variance 
theory [107,108]) based upon the Free Energy Principle [102,109] 
(Figure 1). In ActInf, generative models about the world (as opposed 
to descriptive, reactive, or analytical models) support ecologically-
relevant functions of real systems [3,97,110]—for example a person 
trying to catch a ball will move towards where they predict the ball will 
intersect with their trajectory, and motor saccades of the eye during 
reading are related to real-time predictions about which visual 
information will be most informative [111,112]. ActInf captures 
informational and statistical aspects of these generative models and 
how they are updated and communicated by multiscale far-from-
equilibrium systems [104–106,113,114]. ActInf thus presents itself as a 
promising approach to the quantitative study of complex system 
behavior [3,97,110]. In this paper our focus is on situating team 
communication as a case of Active Inference, and exploring various 
avenues where ActInf approaches could be useful for modern teams. 
Here we briefly review several recent developments in the ActInf 
literature that are relevant for our use case of RT. The topics of 
communication, 
narrative, 
and 
culture 
have 
recently 
been 
contextualized within the context of ActInf and the FEP [116–119]. 
Communicating systems such as the brain [120,121] and improvising 
dyads [122] can be formally cast within the ActInf framework, making 
these varied systems amenable to powerful physics-based analyses. For 
humans, the study of semantic interpretation of text is known as 
hermeneutics, which lies at the base of many forms of communication. 
ActInf 
captures 
how 
multiple 
interacting 
agents 
perform 
improvisational hermeneutics at the behavioral timescale (via e.g. 
micro-scale turn taking [122]), scaffolded within cultural niches that 
play out at much longer timescales [123]. The expected status of

communication within human teams is cooperative, facilitating the 
emergence of effective work on large and complicated projects [115]. 
 
Figure 1.    Active Inference (ActInf) is built upon the Free Energy Principle 
(FEP). Internal states (generative model and policy selection) are linked to external 
states (world states), via a Markov Blanket (border between dark and light) which 
is pierced by Sense and Action states. 
 
Figure 2.    In the case of interacting systems, ActInf casts the commonly-accessible 
external world states as an epistemic information niche [115]. 

---PAGE BREAK---
46    The Great Preset 
 
In the case of goal-oriented team work, ActInf explores how agents 
communicate with each other in order to reduce each other’s 
uncertainty about internal (mental) and external (world) states. In order 
to coordinate at higher scales, agents must be connected through 
communication channels (shared epistemic niche) as well as have the 
Bayesian prior belief that attunement or alignment is a desirable 
outcome (desirable since it would reduce uncertainty about achieving 
preferred future sensory states) [115]. Over evolutionary time, the 
priors that communication among similar agents is cooperative 
becomes entrenched through selection (assuming that coordinating 
agents have higher fitness) [4]. These evolutionary and developmental 
expectations about social interactions are enacted and shaped through 
real-time experience – giving a formal sense to the classic phrase 
“through others we become ourselves” [124,125]. We can adapt this 
phrase here to consider how teams form and perform, e.g. “through 
communication with others we become a team”, or “though reducing 
our uncertainty about the future we achieve our shared goals”. 
The rest of this paper is dedicated to exploring the features and 
implications ONFT for teams, using SE and the ActInf framework. 
We focus on the multiple levels of communication that teamwork 
entails (within and between teams), and some of the special aspects of 
modern Remote Teams (for example rapidly changing composition 
and augmented or non-human teammates). We explore the possibility 
of creating protocols for RT communication to succeed in the 
development of SoIs, based upon optimized message passing systems 
inspired by ActInf. This perspective for computational communication 
of RT extends naturally from recent work on ActInf in enactive and 
encultured communication. 
SE Approaches to Implementing Active 
Inference in Remote Teams 
Here we highlight the Remote Team (RT) as a tractable "model system" 
for studying the processes of Communication, Narrative co-
construction, collective intelligence, organizational sensemaking, and

organizational management online. The design of successful RTs, now 
more than ever, is essential for the health and productivity of modern 
society circa 2020. We use the multiscale action-oriented framework of 
ActInf to consider the communicative, psychological, and techno-
social dynamics of RTs [4,97,112]. We consider how recent 
developments in online organization, gamification, and platform 
accessibility make formal systems for RT & Instantaneous Remote 
Teams (IRTs) a relevant technology for research and implementation 
[25]. Overall we aim towards Ontologies, Narratives, Formal 
documents, and Tools (ONFT) for RT within the ActInf framework. 
We recast the generalized ActInf setting of Figure 2 into the specific 
case of two (or more) interacting team mates within a shared team 
informational niche (Figure 3). We use the concept of a Markov 
Blanket (MB, see Definitions) and communicating systems to define a 
team as the set of human and non-human agents that share a specific 
informational niche (Figure 4). In ActInf, the MB reflects the 
separation between internal and external system states, pierced by 
active and sensory states [126–128]. In the context of team 
communication, the MB is enacted by the informational boundaries of 
the team, though there may also be permanent or transient internal 
subdivisions [129], especially in large organizations with reconfiguring 
subteams. Communication among team members in RT can take 
various forms (Figure 5), including audio-visual relay (video chat), text 
messages (chat), file sharing, and other forms of information transfer 
(sensors, biofeedback, geospatial information).

Figure 3.    The Team consists of multiple interacting agents, sharing a joint 
informational niche. Each team member is engaged in sensemaking and the 
performance of work through the process of Active Inference. 
 
Figure 4.    From a communicative perspective, Teams are defined by their 
coexistence within a Markov blanket. Individuals also possess their own 
Markovian boundaries, highlighting the need for multiscale formulations that are 
flexible enough to encompass diverse types of agents. The team is defined by its 
composition, shared informational niche, common internal model of the world, and 
affordances for external action.

Figure 5.    Here are the types of communication between a user and the Single 
Source of Truth (SSoT) Database. Within the scope of Team communication, a 
single team-mate may experience various kinds of sensory inputs, and participate in 
various action affordances. Not visualized here are communicative features such as 
synchronous/asynchronous dynamics, multiple team-mates, or other attributes of 
RT. 
 
Figure 6.    Team narratives are like a fulcrum or leverage point that shapes the 
observable communication patterns of teams. Multiscale Team narratives 
contextualize internal model and policy decisions of individual team mates, which 
influence their behavior (thus feeding back into the team informational niche and 
altering the narrative itself). 
 

---PAGE BREAK---
50    The Great Preset 
 
We consider narratives as tools that have functional roles in Teams 
(Figure 6). At the same time narratives can be generative models 
(enacted or latent generative dynamics). Our focus is on team behavior, 
in that we want to attune communication in the interest of achieving 
certain results. This focus on quality production of artifacts will be 
behaviorally accomplished in real teams through the design of effective 
communication and regimes of attention. This is consistent with recent 
developments in ActInf which frame cultures (of organizations, teams) 
as “cultural scaffolds” and “regimes of expectations” [97] that through 
communication are able to achieve higher-order goals [105]. 
Remote Teams (RT) are especially tractable for formal analysis of any 
kind because most state transitions in the team are observable. In 
located teams, it can be challenging to capture the nuance of important 
communication techniques such as space use or body language. 
Conversely in an RT, while body language and other qualitative 
ostensive cues may still be critical, an observer can be sure that they are 
at least capturing all of the signals being exchanged (unlike, for 
example, a video camera in a conference room which may be able to 
capture where each person is in the room, but not what each person 
sees). Continuing with this mapping between RT and other far-from-
equilibrium message passing systems graphs that perform Active 
Inference, we can consider all agents (human or non-human) as nodes 
that are connected via communicative edges. The structure of this 
graph is the realized communication system of the team, and thus the 
boundaries of the work-performing aspects of the team. Nodes that 
are informationally connected may be formally related (e.g. via an Org 
chart) or they may be organizationally unlinked. 
Different kinds of communicative edges may reflect different types of 
relationships such as informant or close interpersonal linkage 
(friendship or “buddyship”, reflecting a highly synchronized shared 
generative model). In the RT, because all communications are via 
online transfer, this exocortex is a key Enabling System [130,131]. This 
means that we can define the Enabling System in terms of all 
communication events (in Online space), and for each event provide 

---PAGE BREAK---
ActInf & Behavior Engineering for Teams    51 
 
defined roles & protocols. Narratives for communication are essential 
for all sorts of team relationships. Narratives can be social functions 
that create a cognitive niche, thus reducing collective/individual 
uncertainty [115,132]. Within the context of a narrative that sets the 
team goal and function, there is a process of exocortex-driven Division 
of Labor. Functional ontologies are relevant for the role-assignment 
stage, whereas the System-level ontology steps in to help workers make 
sense of what they should do. 
We see Active Inference as something like a “two stroke engine” for 
Remote Teams (ACT –> INFER –> ACT –> …), accomplished 
through the communicative structure or “Syntax” of the RT (also see 
OODA loops [133,134]). In all cases, everything is based upon, or 
supported by tools. This means that work is performed through 
observable sequences of Events (taking place at a specific time with 
specific syntax/grammar) which result in meaningful progressions of 
events (narrative semantics). For an event to exist, there must be a 
measurable change in a system state or Alpha [135]. From the 
perspective of the team members, communication about narratives is 
of the utmost importance, as narratives set the stage for interpretation 
of subsequent signals. Narratives are strong enough to serve as 
nucleating or rallying points for located protests as well as all-online 
IRTs, underlining the need to understand how memes and narratives 
interact in modern informational ecosystems [25]. 
Discussion 
Here we use the framework of ONFT to highlight specific areas where 
ActInf could be applied: 
ONTOLOGIES 
Active Inference could inspire action-oriented ontologies for 
Remote 
Teams, 
describing 
team 
composition, 
communication systems, work performance, informational 
channels, hardware/software, and more. This leads to the 
idea of interoperable RT from different organizations (e.g. 

---PAGE BREAK---
52    The Great Preset 
 
using standards for metadata that allow for data 
transformation and Business, Operations, Legal, Technical, 
and Social inter-team communications and situational 
awareness such as those proposed through work on Coalition 
Battle Management Language [136–138])).  
Required ontological information for team communication 
could include (Date, Time, Sender, Role, Alpha). Optional 
information could include (Seals, Symbols, Context, and 
Signposts for regimes of attention). 
An ActInf-based ontology for Narratives would allow the 
design or control of narratives in RT. This might be facilitated 
by tools like Sentiment analysis, visualization techniques, and 
machine learning of social media data. Other researchers have 
sketched out common cases where narratives for online 
teams already exist, how could a formal structure make this 
more manageable? 
In terms of Team membership and informational 
ingresses/emissions, ontologies for multi-agent systems and 
Markov Blankets might allow for the design of internal and 
external representations of work performance [2]. 
NARRATIVE 
Narrative alignment is dynamic and grows between members 
of teams through peer or “horizontal” bonding [84]. 
Organizations which consist of many teams may experience 
narrative alignment via both horizontal and vertical bonding, 
that is, bonding with team-mates and members of other teams 
as well as bonding with supervisors [84]. The highest level of 
narrative alignment might be best described with the military 
term “esprit de corps”, where mutual sense of mission, trust, 
ideals, culture, and shared threats allow alignment to 
transcend self-interest, specific unit membership, and limits 
on intimate relationships [84,139–142]. Narrative alignment 

---PAGE BREAK---
ActInf & Behavior Engineering for Teams    53 
 
associated with “esprit de corps” creates behavioral ideals, 
objectives, heroic tradition, and culture or “regimes of 
expectations” for individuals to align and conform with in 
order 
to 
cope 
with 
high 
levels 
of 
uncertainty 
[1,4,71,83,97,142,143]. ActInf frameworks for RT could 
promote a digital “esprit de corps” that is observable and also 
tractable to interface with.  
The value of communication patterns in the RT could be 
quantified in terms of value for the team narrative, as proxied 
by novel evidence for (updated distribution of) shared 
generative models. This is similar to how backpropagation 
training of neurons in an artificial neural network updates 
parameters based upon contribution to error, or how 
Numer.ai rewards machine learning models proportionally to 
how they contribute to the success of an automated trading 
bot [144].  
At different levels, we can associate different functions for 
different generative narratives of interest. We need to be able 
to name, trace, and document the states of narratives (as well 
as capture pluralistic interpretations of multi-person 
narratives).  
A focus on function and role performance within a narrative 
context could improve the performance of work and the 
experience of team members. This is because narratives are 
functions that provide Identity and Meaning across multiple 
scales. From a SE perspective, Narrative is just another SoI 
that we can reduce our uncertainty about, towards the end of 
system design and cybernetic control. Just as with other 
Complex control questions, we are able to design/control at 
the Systems level by making the right abstraction for coarse-
graining (here, Markov Blankets that allow us to ignore 
hidden internal states).

54    The Great Preset 
 
FORMAL DOCUMENTS 
ActInf could inform the design of documents that relate 
multiscale event frameworks. Each event has prerequisites, 
inputs/outputs (functionalism), consequences & outcomes, 
roles, problems in focus, expectations, and predictions. 
Formal documents capture which engineering metadata 
needs to be present (e.g. reference data format) in order to 
perform life cycle analysis on SoI. 
Formal Documents for the work day and week could improve 
the experience of workers: 
• Morning documents: providing narrative alignment 
and informational update for the day. 
• End-of-day documents: providing closure to the day, 
filling out information about progress. 
• Monday documents: providing narrative Alignment 
for the week (mission, culture, identity, collective 
sense-making, where are we in the bigger niche?)  
• Friday documents: providing closure for the work 
week. 
TOOLS 
Tools are required in all of the above domains so that 
professional, innovative, effective, inclusive Remote Teams 
can implement effective ActInf frameworks of any kinds. 
Current common (and often free) tools include chat, file-
sharing, voice/video, CRM, Single Source of Truth software, 
etc. Such tools will be helpful for ActInf-based teams, and 
also new kinds of tools may be required. Given the total 
observability of RT, toolkits such as SPM [145,146] and 
multiscale analytics could help attune RT communication 
towards desired products. Human-in-the-loop machine 
learning systems based upon ActInf could allow for actions 

---PAGE BREAK---
ActInf & Behavior Engineering for Teams    55 
 
and perceptions to be designed and controlled in real-time at 
a fine scale [104,147].   
For RT communication across platforms, it would be helpful 
to design common database formats that link protocols, for 
example using an API connector like Matterbridge [148]. This 
would allow for the effective management of the tradeoff 
between centralized, private, and decentralized backends that 
use custom metadata, and user-facing platforms with 
customizable UI/UX and dynamic data updating. This kind 
of “total comms” understanding, and ability to design 
effectively within the space of possible RT, would reduce 
platform fragmentation and increase worker effectiveness.  
Inspiration from nature (biomimicry) could provide new 
tools and perspectives on how different work functions could 
be performed by different cognitive niches [6,149]. 
Computer-assisted design (CAD) Tools for communication 
charts would allow the formalization of “Markov 
communicative blankets”. This could facilitate the formation 
of collective cognitive entities that can then be understood, 
compressed, templated, optimized, and reconsidered from 
multiple perspectives [150]. Tools for regimes of 
synchronous & asynchronous attention would allow for the 
optimal design of ostensive cues and salient epistemic 
signals—“events only happen when the listener is paying 
attention”.  
The future of the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference is bright 
but uncertain. Through our cybernetic communication and actions in 
the now, we reduce our uncertainty about the hereafter.

Active Inference. Active inference (ActInf) is an action-oriented 
process theory that is related to the formal multiscale framework of 
Free Energy Principle (FEP) [3,109]. ActInf posits that action-
perception cycles link external and internal systems, through sensory 
and active states that bidirectionally constitute a system-specific 
boundary known as a Markov Blanket (MB). ActInf is related to areas 
such as Cybernetics [152], Niche construction [110], Information 
foraging [111], linguistics [105], Variational Bayesian machine learning 
techniques [104]. 
Engineered System. (1) An open, concrete system of technical or

while complying with applicable constraints [153].

continuous change, this paper begins to address how formal systems

As empirical results we want to show some examples of 
Team_Comm’s work on this paper. Team_Comm is an all-online 
Remote Team which joined forces to achieve a result which was not 
possible individually (at least in the same timeframe) due to the 
interdisciplinary nature of the research. This team originated 
unpredictably, following the independent actions of members in a 
shared information niche (Discord server of the Lex Fridman podcast). 
Subsequently the team’s communication moved to the platform of 
Keybase which allowed for the construction and development of a 
private informational niche. Several of the topics addressed in this 
paper can be unpacked here in relationship to how we carried out this 
work: 
Division of Labor. Different members of the Team_Comm have 
backgrounds in academia, Complexity Science, Systems Engineering, 
and Remote Team management. We thus treated the paper as a System

able to prepare the paper in accordance with best research and SE

communicated and aligned shared Narratives on different levels: about

We were using different tools to support coordination, communication

(public Keybase team @karlfriston.freeenergy, shared Keybase

CHAPTER IV 
The Facilitator’s Catechism 
Richard J. Cordes & Daniel A. Friedman 
 
ABSTRACT 
This paper discusses the origins and evolution of Operations Orders 
from antiquity to modern times and the impact of Operations Orders 
on organizational sensemaking. Perspectives from research on 
Complexity Science, Organizational Psychology, High Reliability 
Organizations, Memetics, Logistics, Knowledge Management Systems, 
and Active Inference are used to consider the historical, contemporary, 
and future requirements and constraints of Operations Orders. 
Examples of traditional military Operations Orders and their civilian 
counterparts are detailed in context with their respective environments 
and requirements. Key characteristics of survivability, contemporary 
and future requirements, and current limitations of extant Operations 
Orders are addressed in order to inform the proposal of a new 
Operations Order format for use by Process Facilitators of military, 
intelligence, and civilian teams: the “Facilitator’s Catechism”.

Introduction 
In this article we begin with a discussion of the origins and histories of 
Operations Orders. We will then explore a few key factors of high-
performance teams that are generalizable to reflexive systems with 
agency: ongoing recalibration, goal-setting, and sensemaking. We then 
discuss how the development of the Operations Order through time 
and space reveals general principles of team organization, situational 
responsiveness, and adaptation to changes in the environment. 
Historically, shifts in operational reach, environmental uncertainty, and 
mission ambiguity have led to major transitions in the functional role 
and expected format of in-field Operations Orders. This recognition 
leads to a formulation at the end of this work of a “Facilitator’s 
Catechism”, a first presentation of a new variant of an Operations 
Order for military, intelligence, and civilian teams that builds upon 
previous formats and also catalyzes teams in situations where the 
mission may be unclear, team composition may be dynamic, and where 
novel online affordances are available. 
Origins and Histories of Operations Orders 
Operations Orders (OPORDs) are traditionally described as a 
formatted, written deliverable that describes explicit instructions for a 
military unit to enact [1–4]. OPORDs are different from simple 
requests in that OPORDs are accompanied by expectations regarding 
execution and tend to have a specified format, use a codified ontology, 
and convey the scope of the mission or situation. There can be found 
references to OPORD-like documents in a number of classical works 
on military theory and history, such as those by Caesar, Livy, Polybius, 
Tacitus, and Clausewitz, but they are rarely discussed as an object of 
interest [5–12]. Classical works do not seem to indicate rigorous 
adherence to a single type of OPORD format as a norm, but the 
existence of formatted operations orders is often argued to be obvious 
and in some cases is verified directly [9]. Given that the Roman Army 
has so often served as the source of ideals for modern militaries to 
replicate and given its clear status as the common root from which 

---PAGE BREAK---
The Facilitator’s Catechism    67 
 
modern military theory springs, it is an obvious first-candidate for an 
analysis of the origin of OPORDs [9,13,14]. 
Roman Origins of the OPORD 
Analysis of the Roman Army yielded the earliest examples of actual 
order formats with clearly defined organizational requirements in both 
their generation and execution [9]. It should be noted that some of the 
practices of the Roman Army were “so long employed and so well 
established that no one could find evidence for [their] beginning” 
[9,15]. Livy notes the use of the Roman “tessera”, a tablet on which 
short messages might be passed, which was used to transmit orders as 
early as Roman conflicts with the Etruscans in 310 B.C.E. [9,10]. 
Tessera included simple commands to be executed such as “May every 
man (miles) fortify himself first with breakfast, then with weapons” [9]. 
Polybius notes the rigid procedures by which passwords and 
instruction are circulated amongst sentries in Roman camps—
protocols built in such a way as to allow commanding officers to detect 
discrepancies or small errors [9,11]. Given that these rigid processes 
required literacy and that there is clear evidence that sentries were 
drawn from the ranks of common soldiers rather than a designated 
corps, the sentry order has been argued as evidence that most soldiers 
in the Roman Army were literate [9,12,16]. While, at first glance, the 
notion of a majority of Roman soldiers being literate may seem 
surprising, it should be noted that the Spartan Army was formalized 
long before the Roman Army and was highly literate (despite being 
described as “uneducated” by the Athenians), and required its soldiers 
to interact with documentation as a matter of course [9,16–18]. 
Roman sentry orders demanded rigid format in regards to their 
informational content, typically including just communication 
instruction in the form of passwords to be used, whereas general orders 
passed via tessera within Roman camps seem to have demanded clarity 
and concision not by order of doctrine but by constraints on the 
medium (tessera tablets were small and not very easily inscribed) [9–
11,15]. Given the limited number of legions to guard such large 
expanses of frontier, communication via oral instruction and inscribed 

---PAGE BREAK---
68    The Great Preset 
 
tablets became nearly synonymous with “operational reach” as defined 
in modern military literature [1,19,20]. It is clear that consistent and 
reliable communication of “service orders”, or requests for 
reinforcements and supplies, were what allowed the Roman Army to 
maintain operations despite asymmetries between the available soldiers 
and the size of the frontier as well as the number of incursions and 
internal rebellions [6,19]. The ability to transport troops was secondary 
to the ability to inform officers as to where their troops were needed. 
Efficient and reliable military communication defined the operational 
reach of the Roman Empire beyond the border-forts and rivers which 
marked the edges of its territories [19]. 
Modern Transformations of the OPORD 
Operations Orders developed significantly between the time of Rome 
and the late 19th century. The most substantive developments in 
OPORD format were likely driven by a renaissance in military theory 
guided by European and American military academies between the 
17th and 19th centuries [21–23]. During this time, European 
commanders began to cohere to rigid standards for descriptive 
language in situation reports and OPORDs, such as the phrasing: 
“From reports received it seems probable that the enemy intends to…” 
which was common amongst German officers [23]. The convergence 
upon interoperable and standardized OPORDs during this period was 
possibly enforced by cultural norms, or “regimes of expectations”, 
rather than by explicit doctrine [23,24]. However, these cultural norms 
were subjected to unforgiving environments that did not indulge 
maladapted behavior or over-imitation [25–27]. For example, the 
French Armies of the Republic of the 1870s used OPORDs which 
consisted of multiple pages of minute details, which “accounts of the 
battles show were not carried out” [23]. In contrast, the march on Paris 
in 1870 by German troops by General Helmuth von Moltke was 
specified in only eighteen lines, and accounts suggest that “not a 
battalion crossed another in its march, went hungry, or [camped in 
vulnerable positions]” [23].

centuries of regular, organized European conflict, the common 
elements of the “field order” form and then conform to such an extent 
that they are identified and then formalized by U.S. Cavalry General 
Eben Swift [4,23]. General Swift submits a standardized format for 
OPORDs in 1897 (see Figure 1 and Appendix A) based on his analysis 
of German “Command and Control” (C2) doctrine which was 
primarily developed by Generals Moltke and Griepenkerl during the 
Franco-Prussian War [4,28]. 
Swift based his OPORD format on the German, mission-oriented 
OPORDs, arguing that task-orders must be written with very limited 
jargon, short sentences, legible hand-writing, and with no unnecessary 
information [3,23]. He specifically noted that apology, conjecture, 
expectations, and reasoning should be absent and suggests that the 
German officers corps separated out conjecture, expectation, and 
reasoning by issuing what was called “Orders of the Day”, which rarely 
concerned logistical orders regarding the movement of troops; rather 
the documents of this kind “read like the army column of a newspaper” 
[3,23]. During the American Civil War, General Meade offered his 
“Circulars” in a similar fashion [23]. Swift’s innovation, or distillation 

---PAGE BREAK---
70    The Great Preset 
 
from German C2 doctrine, was to frame the OPORD as entirely 
separate from the situation report by making it an action-oriented 
document that focuses on objective, conveying only the necessary 
details regarding the context and tactics of the situation [23]. Swift also 
noted that the specificity of the order is proportionate to the level of 
command and thus the “information of the general situation” section 
of a commander’s OPORD may be long and may sometimes read on 
its own as a “situation report” [3,23]. His basis for arguing the necessity 
of action-oriented OPORDs was two-fold. First, he suggested that 
only preventative and recalibrative action can prevent cascading 
failures across large organizations induced by minor perturbations. 
Second, he thought that complicated, lengthy documents increase the 
risk of perturbations and miscommunication rather than lessen it 
[3,23]. Using modern parlance, we can say that military communication 
is a complex threat surface because it offers many intuitive and 
unintuitive potential failure modes [3,23,29,30]. 
Swift’s format was accepted as a valid formalization and incorporated 
into U.S. Army Field Service Regulations [31,32] and later was modified 
for its use in World War I by American Expeditionary Forces (see 
Figure 2 and Appendices B and C) [33,34]. The format became far 
more compartmentalized and detailed relative to the form originally 
proposed by Swift. It could be argued that these modifications were 
the result of a U.S. War Department that had begun to develop a view 
of war that was becoming increasingly professionalized and 
mechanistic, developing a view which did not allow for the messiness 
of small teams exercising agency on the battlefield: all orders would 
have to be carried out exactly as written with very little room for 
interpretation [22,35]. Military theorists of the early 20th century 
imagined apocalyptic battles of tens of thousands of cavalry and 
hundreds of thousands of men in concerted charges, battles in which 
single, perfectly orchestrated maneuvers would determine the whole of 
a war with immediacy [22]. It was argued that operations such as trench 
warfare would require many rehearsals long in advance with an exact 
process of executions [3,22,35]. However, the prevention of agency on 
part of the field officers often led to miserable disaster during the war, 

---PAGE BREAK---
The Facilitator’s Catechism    71 
 
examples of such disasters are present in accounts of the infamous 
Battle of the Somme in which the French and British used some 
elements of this mechanistic philosophy to plan a joint offensive that 
eventually succeeded in achieving territorial gains, but did so at extreme 
cost [22,36]. 
 
Figure 2.    Suggested WWI Field Order adapted from [34], expanded in 
Appendix B. 
Single OPORD issuances affected many sub-organizations with 
different objectives and methods of execution, this greatly increased 
the length and detail of the OPORD and required the assignment of a 
liaison to serve as a bridge between groups [34]. In many cases, the 

---PAGE BREAK---
72    The Great Preset 
 
orders were so detailed and took so long to prepare that they would 
often arrive after they were needed, thus failing to provide guidance at 
critical moments [3,4]. No one lower than a battalion commander was 
allowed to issue a formal field order, and once ordered, they could not 
change [3]. Orders used during this period ordinarily took six hours to 
reach a platoon from a division headquarters [3]. Small teams during 
the Somme were acting asynchronously and were commanded to use 
an inadequate map of the world built on mechanistic expectations of 
support and alignment from and with other teams; a quality they could 
not remedy due to limitations on communications technology and 
protocol [22,36]. This inflexibility, or fragility, in the context of 
changing local circumstances lead to unnecessary loss of life. 
The adapted OPORD in Figure 2 was used by American Expeditionary 
Forces in World War I, but was subjected to evolution and adaptation 
in the field [4,37]. The nature of this adaptation has been suggested to 
have had a relationship with the proficiency of the units in their 
operations: the length of OPORDs progressively became shorter, less 
restrictive in terms of coordinating logistical instructions, and more 
precise as units became more exposed to combat [4,37]. In later 
analyses, it was shown that the successfully adopted modifications 
“adhered closely” [4] to Swift’s original proposed format, evidencing 
its practicality and utility as well as the suggestion that Complex Threat 
Surfaces do not indulge conformity to and over-imitation of 
maladaptive behavior [4,37]. 
The order which results after these adaptations during the war is 
sometimes said to have remained relatively unchanged through 
multiple wars, excluding minor details, until the American war in 
Vietnam (See Appendices D and G) [4]. However, many order formats 
were experimented with between World War I and the Vietnam War, 
including many concurrent versions in accepted doctrine for specific 
use-cases such as “attack, defend, and development” (See Appendices 
E and F) [3,38]. In these new experimental order formats, we see, 
especially in mobile units, the highly mission-oriented standards 
developed by von Moltke and Griepenkerl after the Franco-Prussian

War. This reflects an evolution of military thought toward emphasizing 
the unpredictability and complexity of warfare as well as de-
emphasizing mechanistic expectations of subordinate echelons and of 
the OPORD format itself [3,21,22,39–42]. These “mission-type 
orders” no longer optimized for detail or technique but instead for 
mission, narrative clarity, and “minimum time for issuance” [3]. The 
experimental order formats used between World War I and the 
Vietnam War, regardless of use-case specific format, all demanded that 
the following information be provided to subordinate commanders: 
• What the commander issuing the order wanted to accomplish. 
• What limiting or controlling factors must be observed. 
• What resources and support have been allotted. 
[3] 
Between World War II and Vietnam this use of separate situational 
and logistical OPORDs ends, and a return is made to a single order 
that again adheres to the fundamentals of the five-paragraph structure 
Eben Swift originally suggested [3,4]. This new post-World War II 
format is essentially the one in use by the U.S. Military today (see 
Figure 3 and Appendix G) [43].

OPORDs for Operational Art 
There was a temporary divergence from the Five Paragraph Order 
during the American War in Vietnam (1955-1975) [3]. The Vietnam 
War was characterized by extreme uncertainty given that even 
sensemaking based on geography was unstable due to extensive tunnel 
systems [45], hidden insurgencies [45–47], and challenging terrain 
which could change with the weather [48–50]. While the official 
OPORD standard in doctrine was unchanged for the whole of the 
Vietnam war [4], the five-paragraph order was reduced to three 
paragraphs in field use (See Figure 4 and Appendix H) [3]. 
In such a chaotic environment, where situational awareness and 
territorial gains can be illusory [47], evacuation details became far more 
important than they had been previously or in predictable environs. 
The field-modified Three Paragraph Order used in Vietnam is unique 
among all modern OPORDs in its emphasis on an exit plan (see 
Appendix M). The need to plan amidst fundamental uncertainty in 
Vietnam appears to have served as a catalyst for several distinct 
changes within the U.S. Military [47]. First, the embodied culture 
around the OPORD took a turn to be much more pragmatic and 
flexible, for example by allowing for more inclusion of symbols, 
graphics, and overlays [3]. Second, during this period, unconventional 
warfare (or 4th Generational War [51,52]) and special operations 
became commonplace, requiring the joint improvisational capabilities 
commonly used by small special forces teams in the field. These high 
performance teams are noted in some works to be “masters of chaos” 
and, in stark contrast to the mechanistic views on war of the early 20th 
century, are referred to as "operations artists” [1,53–55]. In other 
words, the 20th century sees the metaphor of advanced warfare evolve 
from that of large teams of engineers, to small teams of artists. 
While “Operational Art” is a modern term, this view on flexible, 
adaptive warfighting as an art-form begins with the earliest and most 
widely recognized treatise on military philosophy: “The Art of War” by 
Sun Tzu [56]. Both warfare and art include elements of tradition and 
heterodoxy, passion and patience, skill sets and teamwork, and

The Facilitator’s Catechism    75 
 
preparation and improvisation. Historically, cavalry were typically 
given very generalized orders and allowed to exercise a great deal of 
agency in the field [30,57]. Late 19th century analyses of the American 
Civil War described the leaders of the Confederate Cavalry, such as 
General John Morgan or General Jeb Stuart, in a way similar to artists 
[30].  
The descriptions of the “artistry” of cavalry in the 19th century indicate 
that they were performing similar roles as modern operational artists 
within U.S. special forces: disruption of supply lines and 
communications, destabilization of fortifications, psychological 
operations, and reconnaissance all at, or beyond, the edge of their 
parent army’s operational reach [30,57]. Reconnaissance, and this 
action at the limits of an army’s operational reach in general, are often 
referred to as “art” directly as well [57]. General Morgan for example, 
is characterized to be something of a self-educated savant, who was 
highly “improvisational” and adept at bricolage in the field beyond the 
reach of conventional support [30]. A summary of one of General 
Morgan’s raids notes that he discovered and captured a telegraph 
agency while in the process of being cut off from the army and used it 
to reroute enemy troops and intercept messages about his position [30]. 
Further confirming his ability to improvise in the field, a field summary 
of his ”first” raid suggests that he leveraged the psychological impact 
of his success to recruit new soldiers: "He started with 900 men, lost 
ninety and returned with 1,200, was absent twenty four days, traveled 
1,000 miles, captured seventeen towns, destroyed all the government 
supplies and arms in them, dispersed 1,500 home guards, and paroled 
1,200 regulars" [30]. A mechanistic OPORD, such as the one later used 
by American Expeditionary Forces during World War I [4,22,35], 
would have denied Morgan and other Civil War cavalry officers such 
successes by denying agency to act on opportunity. However, it should 
be noted that Morgan is eventually captured. Morgan’s failure can be 
attributed to poor situational awareness, an inability to communicate 
with the main force, poor discipline, and a lack of an evacuation plan 
[30].

Figure 4.    U.S. Vietnam War Three-Paragraph 
Order, adapted from [3]. 
A century later, we find echoes of Morgan’s failure and successes in the 
deployment of OPORDs used by Israeli Defence Forces. Where many 
European OPORDs conformed to U.S. standards during the Cold War 
(with limited variation observed even in the Soviet OPORD, Appendix 
I), Israel’s OPORD form diverged significantly (see Figure 5 and 
Appendix J) [3]. Israel’s OPORD formats placed far more emphasis on 
the commander's intent, both in the culture and techniques associated 
with writing the OPORD as well as in the format itself [3,58]. The 
Israelis, aligned with the views of Moltke, Swift, and Griepenkerl by 
embracing the agency of small tactical units in the field [3,58] and in 
doing so, earn a “worldwide recognition for excellence in mobile 
warfare” [3]. The Israeli Defence Force operated under the 
presupposition that “a detailed plan is only good until the first bullet is 
shot” [3] and placed emphasis on a metaphysical doctrine defined by 
“individual daring (heaza), maintenance of aim (dvekut bamatara) and 
resourcefulness (tushia)” [58]. Moshe Dayan, former Defense Minister 
of Israel, noted in his war diary:  
"To the commander of an Israeli unit I can point on a map to the Suez 
canal and say: 'There's your target and this is your axis of advance. 
Don't signal me during the fighting for more men, arms, or vehicles. All 

---PAGE BREAK---
The Facilitator’s Catechism    77 
 
that we could allocate you've already got, and there isn't any more. Keep 
signaling your advances. You must reach Suez in forty-eight hours"' 
[59]. 
The Israeli Defence Force used this focus on commander's intent in 
order to develop strong narrative alignment [60] between units in the 
field in a way that strongly resembles the German concept of 
“Auftragstaktik”, a concept deemed essential to the success of the 
German Panzer Korps during World War II [39,58,61,62]. 
Auftragstaktik translates, roughly, to “Mission-Type tactics”; it is a 
term representative not of a particular set of maneuvers but instead of 
an organizational culture which was developed over the course of 
“three wars: the Danish-Prussian War of 1864, the Austro-Prussian 
War of 1866 and the Franco-Prussian War of 1870” [61,63]. This 
organizational culture revolves around taking initiative in the field 
based on “grundlegende Lageänderung”—fundamental changes to the 
situation in the area of operations [28]. The formalization of the 
organizational culture of Auftragstaktik begins with the same General 
Helmuth von Moltke from which Eben Smith derives his formalization 
of the Five Paragraph Order [3,64]. Moltke, a disciple of Clausewitz, 
argues that decentralization, agency, bricolage, asynchronicity, 
individual and team initiative, and narrative alignment are the basis by 
which wars will be won in the future [61,64]. Most important to 
Auftragstaktik is a sense of Esprit de Corps, a narrative alignment not 
just between individuals but between individuals and the “spirit” and 
collective ideals of an organization as a basis for overcoming limitations 
on the development of intimate relationships, maintaining trust in the 
organization and comrades, and prevention of disintegration or route 
[25,29,60,65–68] Moltke comes to these conclusions while holding 
command positions in a Prussian Army which had recently failed to 
achieve consistent success during the Napoleonic Wars [61,64]. It 
should be unsurprising that Eben Swift, a cavalry officer who served in 
the American Indian Wars [69], a series of conflicts which had 
conditions similar to those Americans faced a century later in Vietnam, 
would find value in Moltke’s analysis and conclusions [22,47,48].

78    The Great Preset 
 
The first Israeli experiment in extreme agency experienced some 
failures however. During the 1967 war, “entire battalions became lost 
in the sand dunes”, as limited control over units acting at the limits of 
the army’s operational reach resulted in the same sort of 
“misadventure” [3] that led to General Morgan’s capture [30,58]. Post-
1967, the Israelis experiment with an “optional control” system that 
offered a more pragmatic approach to Auftragstaktik allowed for 
subordinate leaders to take maximum initiative while allowing for 
command to intervene [58]. This system experienced failures as well, 
but these failures have been deemed to be more likely the result of an 
over-centralization of command structure, lack of planning, and poor 
intelligence collection, analysis, and distribution [58]. The conclusions 
regarding the basis and impacts of poor intelligence practice during the 
Israeli’s 1973 War is consistent with expectations formed by modern 
research on the impacts of knowledge management systems on 
organizations [29,58,59,70–72]. 
Israel also experienced wild successes in their allowance of “operational 
art”, achieving “lightning fast”, significant victories likened by experts 
to that of Germany’s capture of France and Napoleon’s successful 
campaigns [73]. In the same 1967 war in which “entire battalions 
became lost in the sand dunes” [30,58], the IDF was also internationally 
declared to be a textbook example of the expression of all classical 
principles of success in warfare: “speed, surprise, concentration, 
security, information, the offensive, [and] above all training and 
morale” [3,73,74]. 
Israel’s renown for artistry in the sort of highly flexible, mobile 
operations that were (correctly) expected to be the norm in future 
warfare made their OPORD (see Figure 5 and Appendix J) the subject 
of study in the late 1980s on the basis that it might provide insight and 
inspiration for the basis of a new OPORD for the United States [3]. 
Instead, the United States Military kept the five paragraph order, but 
seems to have embraced the concept of “operational art” as it is now 
contained in many doctrine publications in use across all branches of 
service of the US Military, in some cases, even in the foreword, as a 

---PAGE BREAK---
The Facilitator’s Catechism    79 
 
defining context for doctrine [1,20,75]. A key element of this modern 
operational art is the notion of being able to rapidly adjust maneuvers 
around new “centers of gravity” (COGs) in the area of operations, 
these COGs have similar characteristics to “strange attractors” in 
dynamical systems theory [1,76,77]. The modern U.S. Military’s Five 
Paragraph Order allows for adjustment of an OPORD to respond to 
new COGs through the use of a “Fragmentary Order” or FRAGORD 
[1,78–82]. The FRAGORD has the same format of a Five Paragraph 
Order but the writer only includes changes to the OPORD to which it 
is tied, allowing it to act as an ad hoc overlay over the original [1,78–
82].

OPORDs in the Modern Gray Zone 
In the late 20th and early 21st century, OPORDs became the subject 
of plans for development in the interest of making them machine-
readable, through research on “Coalition Management Battle 
Language” [83–88], This planning is in response to difficulties in all 
aspects of managing operations composed of units which are 
embedded in varied hierarchies, such as those coming from different 
branches of service during special forces operations or those from 
different nations in peacekeeping or coalition operations [1,70,89]. 
Despite this planning and the rapid changes in technological 
affordances, OPORDS have not been subject to any recent significant 
changes [1,43,44]. This may be misleading however, as this is only the 
case if we require OPORDs to have purely military purposes. Given 
our discussion of the origins and histories of OPORDs, it would 
appear that the key criteria for a document to be classified as an 
OPORD would be that it intends to communicate a “mission” or task 
to some object that intends to interpret and execute and is 
accompanied by expectations of completion informed by a regime of 
expectations, such as the one provided by a commander-subordinate 
or other formal relationship. Inclusion of components which confer 
situational awareness are not criteria for classification as an OPORD, 
but instead increase the likelihood of successful execution by offering 
an effective regime of expectations and therefore shape behavioral 
affordances and collective outcomes [24,60,90]. Given these criteria, 
we suggest that there are civilian counterparts to the military OPORD. 
Related to OPORDs in uncertain contexts, there is a long history of 
non-military operations orders for engineering projects, commerce, 
and teams. As early as 500 B.C.E. there are written, compartmentalized 
joint venture agreements in the Levant and North Africa which carry 
expectations of execution and include components that note what it is 
that the members of the party shall execute (mission) as well as context 
(situation) [91]. Machine instructions for operating systems in 
computer science have been described as commands or collections of 
commands which a computer can interpret and execute [92]. The 
modern practices of business and project planning converge on similar 

---PAGE BREAK---
The Facilitator’s Catechism    81 
 
OPORD-like documents to communicate mission, expectations for 
execution, and situational awareness [93–97]. 
The "Heilmeier Catechism" is an OPORD format which exists in the 
gray zone between military and civilian application (see Figure 6 and 
Appendix K) and is used by The Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency (DARPA) in the direction of research activity [98–100]. The 
chaos of the American war in Vietnam effectively transformed 
DARPA (originally known as ARPA) to make it much more focused 
on supporting the Department of Defense, thereby heightening 
requirements for reliability [98]. In 1975, an engineer, military history 
buff, and former Department of Defense Fellow [101] named George 
Heilmeier became the director of DARPA [98,101]. As director, 
Heilmeier had to contend with the paradox of managing needs for 
military efficiency while also allowing for ambitious innovation in the 
pursuit of the high-risk/high reward research outcomes in short time 
scales which were required by its mission [98,102]. Heilmeier thought 
of DARPA as a “mission agency” and sought to align all projects with 
the mission to support the Department of Defense [98,102]. Heilmeier 
led DARPA with a “heavy hand”, but didn’t micromanage operations, 
opting instead to review all DARPA projects to check for clearly 
articulated objectives and milestones [98]. Heilmeier introduces a set of 
questions that he described as a “pre-flight checklist” for launching 
complex research projects [101] which he preached as a catechism” 
[98,101,102]. 
A catechism is traditionally a set of questions or prompts with defined 
answers, used as a basis to express or teach spiritual doctrine to rapidly 
build narrative alignment among members of an organization [60,103]. 
Where the 17th century “Westminster Catechism” attempts to build 
narrative alignment between the members and leaders of the Church 
of Scotland and that of England by asking and answering questions like 
“What is the chief end of man!” [103], the Heilmeier Catechism (see 
Figure 6 and Appendix K) is a template to build narrative alignment 
between members of research teams and the mission of DARPA by 
asking questions like “What are you trying to do?” and “If successful, 

---PAGE BREAK---
82    The Great Preset 
 
what difference will it make?” [3,58,60,61]. The open question-
response format of the catechism elicits participation, inclusion, joint 
ownership, and innovative team impact (as opposed to an inflexible or 
memorized creed, which may promote identity or alignment but rarely 
satisfices as an action plan). 
 
Figure 6.    Heilmeier Catechism, adapted from [98] 
The Heilmeier Catechism is well aligned with the philosophy behind 
the OPORDs inspired by the organizational culture of Auftragstaktik 
and especially well aligned with the Israeli OPORD in that it gives a 
great, almost metaphysical emphasis on unit agency [3,98] There are 
many qualities which make the Heilmeier Catechism unique in relation 
to other OPORDs. First, the Heilmeier Catechism is written by the 
team which intends to execute the order and presented to DARPA for 
interpretation and acceptance. This is in contrast with the traditional 
“top-down” pattern of commanders writing and presenting orders to 
the subordinate teams. DARPA releases information regarding the 
nature of their current mission and teams (subordinate) that are 

---PAGE BREAK---
The Facilitator’s Catechism    83 
 
interested in supporting that mission create proposals, built using a 
Heilmeier Catechism (OPORD), for a DARPA program manager 
(commander) to evaluate [98,102]. Second, OPORDs and OPORD-
like documents such as the American Five Paragraph Order or its 
sibling the “PLANORD” (Planning Order) have require a relatively 
large amount of supplementary material to ensure that they are 
prepared 
properly 
[1,43,70,75], 
whereas 
a 
Heilmeier 
compartmentalizes using simple questions—nullifying any need for 
supplementary material. If the questions within the catechism are 
successfully interpreted and answered, there is no checklist with which 
one must comply in order to ensure it’s been prepared correctly. 
Finally, because of this rearrangement of the OPORD process, the 
flexibility, and ease of preparation of this format, we posit that the 
Heilmeier Catechism is an OPORD that allows for emergent remote 
research teams to practice operational art in civilian settings. 
OPORDS for Goal-Setting & OPORDs for 
Sensemaking 
We now turn toward contemporary research on Complexity Science, 
Active Inference, and High Reliability Organizations, to set a basis for 
examining the impact of OPORDs on organizational performance. 
The modern context of online and hybrid remote teams, distributed 
over large geospatial areas, provides new challenges and affordances 
for strategy and OPORDS. The modern digital operating theater 
requires the adequate distillation of the common features of OPORDs 
in context with the basis for their impact. 
“High Reliability Organizations” (HROs) are multiscale systems where, 
due to the high potential for errors to cause cascading, non-linear 
impact, errors must be controlled to an extremely high level of 
stringency [27,29,104,105]. This high potential for cascading system 
failure modes is a product of the Complex Threat Surfaces that HROs, 
such as Aircraft Carrier Crews, Firefighters, and Emergency Medical 
Treatment Teams, must reliably manage [25,27,29,106]. Complex 
Threat Surfaces are a key feature of systems in which cause and effect 

---PAGE BREAK---
84    The Great Preset 
 
relationships exist, but may be mechanistically complicated (e.g. a 
body), conditional, or otherwise difficult to quantify and predict [29]. 
As a consequence, they often cannot be de-risked linearly and the 
threats which emerge from them can be extraordinarily difficult to 
predict or model effectively and present the risk of nonlinear failure 
modes if exploited [29,107]. Systems in nature are adapted to display a 
tremendous resilience to the kinds of difficult to predict perturbations 
which are caused by interactions with Complex Threat Surfaces [108–
111]. The development of precision instrumentation for the 
monitoring of Complex Threat Surfaces is challenging due to 
confounding variables, problems with observability, and the 
fundamental difficulty of simulating appropriate counterfactuals for 
multiscale missions [29,41,112,113]. 
HROs are sometimes noted to be “nearly error-free” [106,114] or 
characterized by low rate of error, but this may be a misleading 
designation as it requires a definition of “error” which is synonymous 
with failure [27,106]. From this: fault detection, real-time diagnosis, 
tolerance to variability, and similar metrics of resilience can often be 
more useful metrics than “error-rate” in defining the functional 
reliability of complicated systems like hardware and complex systems 
like organizations [27,105,106,115,116]. The basis for creating fault 
tolerance in hardware is largely determined by good design principles 
[115,117] whereas reliability in organizations is generally determined by 
situational awareness, rapid information sharing, and, most 
importantly, the ability to recover and recalibrate [25,118,119]. In both 
hardware and sociotechnical systems, engineering toolkits can provide 
scaffolding and protocols for sensemaking and effective intervention 
and policy design [60]. 
Military organizations are tasked, not only with the monitoring and 
derisking of Complex Threat Surfaces, but also with the creation and 
exploitation of them, and regularly serve as the subject of case studies 
on HROs [27,29,104,106,120,121]. From a systems engineering 
perspective, the OPORD is a tool which is iteratively developed over 
time to contribute to the factors of team success most dampened by 

---PAGE BREAK---
The Facilitator’s Catechism    85 
 
the environment [60]. For example, the late 19th century formalization 
and inclusion of “situation” in the OPORD appears to be a response 
to feedback from environments requiring good information about 
constraints in the locale, such as those found in the American Indian 
Wars which rewarded agency in the field by officers and punished 
inflexibility [22,23,30,57,58] The inclusion of this section about 
constraints obviously intends to rapidly communicate situational 
awareness in uncertain environments. The emphasis on an evacuation 
section in the American’s make-shift Three Paragraph Order during 
Vietnam (see Figure 4 and Appendix H) intends to heighten the ability 
to recover from errors in an environment where, due to extreme 
uncertainty, error was inevitable [3,45–47]. The OPORD, in all its 
forms, has the potential to enable or enhance information sharing 
where the environment or situation would make traditional 
communication 
via 
utterance 
difficult 
or 
unfeasible 
(e.g. 
communication across long distances, communication of orders from 
a single commander to hundreds of subordinate organizations) [9,19]. 
Further, the OPORD may also contribute generally to the ability of 
organizations to calibrate and recalibrate. 
Ongoing recalibration is fundamental to reflexive systems of all scales 
[106,122–125]. Maintaining coherent activity through time, for an ant 
colony, body, military or government, requires the system to respond 
to perceived errors, as well as to the future potential for errors 
[123,126]. For example, one might find a jacket in their house if they 
were cold as a response to deviation between current state and ideal 
state, or if they were planning to go out into the cold soon as a response 
to a prediction of potential deviation between some future state and its 
ideal. This continuous self-regulatory or cybernetic perspective applies 
to biological systems, HROs, and Artificial intelligence algorithms 
[127]. The process theory of Active Inference (a physics-based 
framework that describes how goal-oriented systems interact with their 
surroundings) describes the general relationship between goal-seeking 
systems and their informational niche [124,128,129]. Active Inference 
casts the question of system behavior as a relational mapping between 
internal states (generative models of the world) and external system 

---PAGE BREAK---
86    The Great Preset 
 
states (the causal structure of the outside world). External states 
influence internal states through sensory cues, and updated internal 
states are differentially likely to engage in different action affordances. 
Internal generative models provide natural and engineered systems 
actionable insights from sparse sensory data, by engaging in action-
oriented sensemaking [125]. Active Inference may be a relevant 
framework for developing advanced team education, communication, 
and performance characteristics [60]. In the Active Inference 
framework, conformity to policy and regular communicative norms are 
argued to be strategies to cope with uncertainty [24]. 
Given that this process of ongoing recalibration is fundamental to 
reflexive or “intelligent” systems of all scales, there is an opportunity 
to investigate collective intelligence through the use of dynamical 
analogy. Dynamical analogy is the creation of analogies to the dynamics 
and mechanisms of better understood systems in order to reveal 
avenues of approach for the investigation of those which remain 
enigmatic [130–132]. Dynamical analogy allows for the discovery of 
patterns that transcend single levels of analysis, thus expanding the 
range of possible system framings or intervention approaches in 
complex systems. Here we will explore the potential for dynamical 
analogy between individual and collective intelligence, to understand 
how high performance is achieved in multiscale cognitive systems. 
Literature from the human and collective intelligence fields converge 
on the idea of controlled novelty, or balanced openness, in navigating 
the explore-exploit tradeoffs intrinsic to organization [133,134]. In the 
Five-Factor or “Big-Five” personality traits model, there is a factor 
denoted as “Openness” which is described as being associated with 
openness to novelty, diversity of thought, creativity, and intellect [135]. 
While the link between trait openness and crystallized intelligence is 
sometimes debated [135,136], it would seem that there is, at the least, 
a relationship between “openness” and the resiliency of crystallized 
intelligence against aging and trauma [137,138]. The existence of such 
a relationship forms a stable dynamic analog to collective intelligence, 
given that there are indications of non-linear relationships between the 

---PAGE BREAK---
The Facilitator’s Catechism    87 
 
diversity and tolerance of temporary employees within HROs and the 
number of innovations produced [99,119] as well as between diversity 
within spontaneous, endogenous social networks and the survivability 
and virality of the memes and ideas they generate [139,140]. Further, 
the adjectives that describe organizations capable of “operational art”, 
such as intelligence agencies and special forces, are the same adjectives 
which have high correlations with trait openness [20,70,141,142]. 
Openness is not the only component of Five-Factor analysis which 
may offer insight on the personality and intelligence of organizations—
as analyses of the organizational equivalents of components such as 
neuroticism and conscientiousness have been done as well [143,144]. 
Following this mapping between intelligence of individuals and 
intelligence of teams, there is a literature on “Goal Setting” which has 
been used as a dynamical analogy to catalyze the development of 
Artificial Intelligence [145]. The individual goal-setting should be of 
use for understanding team function, within the context of the idea of 
extended multiscale cognition. Literature on goal-setting is primarily 
concerned with the success of individuals in reaching their end goals 
and, consequently, the characteristics of self-perception which enable 
them to do so [146–149]. The general consensus within literature on 
goal-setting is that when an individual’s confidence in their own skillset 
maps well to actual competence within a domain and this “self-
efficacy” [146,147,150] is paired with team or individual objectives that 
are clear, consistent, and relevant, progress can be reliably achieved 
[146,147,149,150]. Self-efficacy might be described as an internal state 
which coherently maps a regime of expectations or field of affordances 
with coherent objectives [24,151]. Another perspective on self-efficacy 
from the Active Inference point of view might be that agents become 
successful within a niche when their “regime of attention” correctly 
maps internal causal models of the world to possible agent policies (and 
affordance) and outcomes in the world [24,123]. There is a strong 
overlap between the individual-focused conclusions within the 
literature on goal-setting, narrative-focused conclusions on the impacts 
of ideal-setting in religious narratives [152–156], the organization-
focused conclusions on course of action analysis in joint operations 

---PAGE BREAK---
88    The Great Preset 
 
planning [1,20,157], and work-flow focused conclusions in software 
project management [93,94,158], as well as the more broadly 
applicable, systems-focused conclusions such as those on policy 
optimization and divergence minimization in Active Inference 
[24,125,159]. This overlap is described well by a systems engineering 
approach [60] wherein a set “goal” can be characterized as a stable, 
coherent, communicable conception of an ideal from which outcomes 
might deviate, allowing for recalibration in environments where 
uncertainty makes expectations and outcomes difficult to reckon or 
reconcile. 
Adaptations of the OPORD and the conditions under which these 
adaptations occur conform with this analog between individual and 
collective intelligence. Like organisms existing in ecological niches, 
information-processing & sensemaking entities must finesse their 
affordances in order to stay successful amidst uncertainty [24,126]. This 
goal-drivenness of self-organizing systems is essential for their ability 
to act and thrive in challenging settings [160,161]. As previously noted, 
the organizations implementing OPORDs recalibrate the format to 
better match environmental pressures and demands, thereby 
recalibrating their own basis for action in response to error and 
potential for error [3,4,23]. The behavioral engineering of teams is 
suggested to require Ontologies, Narratives, Formal documentation, 
and Tools (ONFT) [60]. In this ONFT framework the OPORD can 
be described as a formal document which incorporates a codified 
ontology in order to efficiently and reliably convey a narrative. This 
narrative rapidly aligns an organization with a regime of expectations 
prior to operations and is used after operations as a basis for 
reconciling the difference between expectations and outcomes. Even 
in very early examples of OPORDs, there is clear intent to use 
OPORDs as a tool to not just orient action but also to gauge its 
success. Roman sentry orders were designed to be compared with 
specific outcomes as a means of detecting impropriety, negligence, or 
malfeasance [9,11]. Post-war analysis of military history is also generally 
done with the intent of driving changes in military philosophy, and is 

---PAGE BREAK---
The Facilitator’s Catechism    89 
 
achieved using a combination of OPORDs and situation reports as a 
basis for gauging success and failure [22,23,36]. 
The U.S. Military has designed processes for managing this process of 
reconciliation in shorter time-scales, one of which is the “After-Action 
Review” (AAR) [78]. An AAR is described as an opportunity to turn 
any event into a training event to “improve individual and collective 
task-task performances to meet or exceed [standards]” [78]. The AAR 
is an analysis done immediately after an OPORD directed event in the 
interest of both reporting failures and successes to stakeholders as well 
as to help the involved parties better understand the divergence or 
alignment between the OPORD and the outcomes to adjust future 
goal-setting and course of action analysis [27,78]. The AAR has clear 
civilian counterparts as well, such as the “sprint retrospective” in the 
software development framework SCRUM [162]. 
A precursor and ongoing constituent of meaningful goal-setting, 
course of action analysis, and policy-making is sensemaking, which is 
described as the act of “organizing sense data until the environment 
becomes sensible or is understood well enough to enable reasonable 
decisions” [1,118,157,163]. Through the lenses afforded by the Active 
Inference, sensemaking might be described as the processes by which 
a system creates useful internal models of the world based upon the 
organization and integration of sense-data from external sources 
[164,165]. The quality of the sensemaking is related to the mapping of 
the external and internal states, as determined by the mapping between 
predicted and actual outcomes of actions informated by internal states 
[163]. Organizational sensemaking is the collaborative process by 
which sense-data about external states is integrated into a coherent, 
shared model that facilitates collaborative action [60,106,118,166]. 
Good organizational sensemaking requires that participants have a 
sense of self-efficacy and mutual trust [25,27,29,118,163]. Thus 
sensemaking depends on reliable, accessible, manageable information 
streams and a clear understanding of what resulting decisions intend to 
accomplish [25,29,106,118,167,168].

90    The Great Preset 
 
Maintaining a single source of truth (SSoT) for protocol, ontology, 
objectives, and workflow-related knowledge is a solution used by 
HROs to maintain integrity, reliability, and clarity in the information 
environment [27,60,169–171]. An SSoT may be temporary or 
interminable, for example the “product backlog” used in the software 
development framework SCRUM is temporary when tied to the launch 
of a product but interminable when tied to the maintenance of one 
[162]. The Military has an interminable SSoT in the form of “Doctrine 
Publications” [1,20,70,75,82,172]. We argue that the OPORD acts as 
both a temporary and interminable SSoT: it is a transient SSoT related 
to the objectives of an organization prior to and during operations, but 
after operations it serves as an SSoT on what the objectives and goals 
of the organization were from the time of its issuance to the time of its 
success or failure. In its capacity as a temporary SSoT, the OPORD, in 
offering compartmentalized information on what support will be 
available, what the rules of engagement are, what constraints exist in 
the locale, and what the organization needs to accomplish, greatly 
expedites sensemaking by defining a bounded informational niche 
[24,173]. While the boundaries of this informational niche only remain 
stable in preparation for operations, positive impacts extend into the 
theater of operations by contributing to self-efficacy and, as previously 
noted, by providing a coherent ideal to move toward [27,146,150,154]. 
Toward a New OPORD 
From the examination of the origins and histories of OPORDs and the 
discussion of organizational sensemaking and the dynamical analogies 
between (a) intelligence in individuals and collective intelligence and (b) 
between reflexive recalibration of systems in general and high reliability 
organizations, we can conclude that the following features are critical 
to the success of HROs and greatly enhanced by the usage of an 
appropriately formatted OPORD: 
• Ongoing, feedback-driven reflexive recalibration of process 
and capability. 

---PAGE BREAK---
The Facilitator’s Catechism    91 
 
• Clear alignment of participants on values, narrative, goals, and 
identity. 
• High quality distributed & multilevel sensemaking. 
We also find a number of emergent patterns within the discussion of 
OPORDs consistent with these conclusions. Evidenced by adaptations 
in both the OPORD and the culture surrounding it in response to 
increased uncertainty and mobility in battle over the course of the 19th 
and 20th centuries: 
• The faster that new centers of gravity may emerge in the 
operating theater, the more flexibility that is required in the 
OPORD. 
• When the nature of warfare undergoes structural changes, 
and/or there is unprecedented levels of uncertainty in the 
operating theater, the necessity for a new OPORD emerges. 
Significant changes to the nature of communication and team 
performance since the late 20th century (e.g. the internet, 4th 
generation warfare, social media, COVID-19) necessitate a 
redevelopment of the norms of OPORDs as other socio-technical 
changes have altered the nature of warfare in the past. Specifically, 
previous iterations of the OPORD have characteristics which limit 
their ability to easily frame key aspects and challenges of a virtual 
theater of operations. Additionally, pre-online OPORDS are generally 
unable to take advantage of some of the new affordances and strategic 
possibilities in the modern era, such as versioning, compression, and 
fluidity in team composition. 
The Heilmeier Catechism is currently recommended for use as an 
OPORD by research teams as a result of its success at DARPA and 
because it helps to answer questions that are important to appraising 
the usefulness of research in general [98,174–176]. The Heilmeier 
Catechism is the obvious best starting point for work of this kind as it 
was built to orient exploratory action within uncharted territory. 
However, the Heilmeier Catechism has limitations for its use in this 

---PAGE BREAK---
92    The Great Preset 
 
new operating theater of IRTs. Specifically the Heilmeier Catechism 
assumes organizational alignment prior to issuance as well as a fixed 
team composition. Both of these implicit assumptions of the Heilmeier 
Catechism are regularly violated by modern online settings [177]. In 
online informational and narrative war and wargames the Centers of 
Gravity are not geospatial but exist in abstract or memetic space, as a 
consequence, teams must be afforded a great deal of flexibility, and 
their team agents must operate with skill, agency, and autonomy [177]. 
Team communication in online teams can run the gamut from constant 
interfacing to absolute radio silence in wildly uncertain informational 
environments—yet even one false positive or false negative 
communication can prevent the team from achieving its mission 
[29,177].  
A new type of OPORD is required to address the novel characteristics 
of online teams, such as the potential absence of command-
subordinate relationship, fully programmable communication systems, 
narrative ambiguity, memetic transfer with adversaries, and dynamic 
team composition. Such an OPORD would need to both synthesize 
the battle-tested elements of past-OPORDs which would invariably 
contribute to team success in the described environment and introduce 
elements and processes which allow it to circumvent the described 
limitations of previous OPORDs. Given that no prior OPORD found 
accounted for lack of extant organizational alignment or potential for 
dynamic and unknown team composition, this appeared to be the most 
difficult limitation to overcome. 
Organizations have three primary means of developing rapid 
alignment: well codified ontology, intimate trust, and narrative [60]. 
Some IRTs are unable to rely on intimate trust by merit of their being 
just recently formed [60,177]. If the IRT lacks prior organizational, 
professional, or cultural alignment, they cannot rely on codified 
ontology, they must rely on shared narrative or shared regimes of 
expectations and affordances [24,60,151,177]. In situations where the 
scope of possible expectations, affordances, and objectives are very 
narrow, such as good Samaritans passing a motorist in danger [178–

---PAGE BREAK---
The Facilitator’s Catechism    93 
 
180] or a group of players encountering a shared threat in a virtual game 
environment, IRTs may form without the presence of systems 
engineering tools [177], in absence of such narrow scope, behavior can 
be modified via ONFT in order to increase the likelihood of 
organization and collaboration [29,60].  
In joint operations planning, a common solution to this problem of 
scope is the assignment of a liaison that has an understanding of the 
operation or problem being faced and makes regular personal contact 
to build and maintain mutual understanding, trust, and a unity of 
purpose and action [34,43]. The private sector has converged on a 
similar solution, with a common job title being a "Customer Success 
Manager", whose job is to maintain alignment of the goals of their 
company's teams with those of their clients [181]. In the Scrum 
framework for software development, the “Scrum Master” manages a 
very similar role [182]. However, as the environments in which 
companies operate become more complex, the role appears to 
conform more with their military counterparts. The company Palantir 
is an HRO which helps militaries and other HROs contend with 
Complex Threat Surfaces by offering tools related to knowledge 
management and discovery [183]. Due to the nature of the companies 
with which they work and the complex environments in which those 
companies operate, single solutions rarely generalize, so every 
consultation can be expected to be considered non-routine [27,184–
186]. Palantir appears to have coined the term Deployment Strategist 
to describe a liaison position between the company’s teams and those 
of the served organization [184–186]. 
While each job has its own industry-specific requirements, the 
abstracted requirements of the liaison, Customer Success Manager, 
Scrum Master and the Deployment Strategist all find overlap within the 
requirements of the role of “Process Facilitator” [187]. Process 
Facilitators are most notably associated with the management of 
meetings [187], but Process Facilitators can also help to manage 
collaborative work, problem solving, and research tasks by helping 
groups align with objectives and process [188–190]. The primary 

---PAGE BREAK---
94    The Great Preset 
 
requirement of Process Facilitators, such as Customer Success 
Managers, liaisons, Deployment Strategists, SCRUM Masters, and 
meeting facilitators, are to maintain group state attributes which lead 
to persistent action through successful management of process 
[27,181,184–190]. Process Facilitators have to practice behaviors, take 
on roles, and stage interventions to develop situational awareness, 
narrative alignment, coordination, and accountability in order to 
maintain successful communications, workflow, production, and 
external interaction (see Figure 7) [181,182,186,187]. 
Given that Process Facilitators have been used as a solution to 
overcome limitations regarding extant organizational alignment and 
potential for dynamic and unknown team composition, and because 
Process Facilitators are already being deployed to handle tasks in the 
domains in which a new OPORD is needed, we argue that an OPORD 
built to overcome such limitations and to be applied in these domains 
should be built for use by Process Facilitators such as Deployment 
Strategists.

The Facilitator’s Catechism 
Here we propose the “Facilitator’s Catechism”, building on the long 
developmental history of the OPORD by distilling essential 
characteristics of military and civilian OPORDs through time and 
offering novel elements to overcome their limitations. The Facilitator’s 
Catechism contains a Header, Footer, and six sections: (1) Situation, 
(2) Mission, (3) Potential Avenues of Approach, (4) Milestones, (5) 
Implications for Outcome, and (6) Administrative, Logistics, and 
Communications. Building from the success of the Heilmeier 
Catechism, each section is paired with questions which, if answered 
with rigor and in good faith, will ensure a format-valid order without 
the need for supplementary materials. The subtitles facilitate both the 
reading and the writing of the OPORD, informing the reader of what 
to expect to be answered in the section and the writer of what they are 
expected to answer. These questions can be treated as 
subcompartments and answered directly or the writer of the OPORD 
may answer them in written paragraphs. The OPORD can also be 
issued from command to subordinate, from subordinate to command, 
or in absence of a command-subordinate relationship. It is also built to 
be versioned but does not implement rigid formatting of text as would 
be required by coalition battle management language [83–88]. The 
Facilitator’s Catechism is built on ONFT and Systems Engineering 
approaches to circumvent limitations of prior OPORDs, especially 
where: 
• Team Composition is not necessarily known prior to writing. 
• Organizational and narrative alignment of members is not 
necessarily achieved prior to writing. 
• The first task, upon team formation, is course of action analysis 
on how to approach a complex problem which requires novel 
solutions, operational art, and bricolage. 
• Due to potential for conflict in the political alignments of 
members, there is a need for strict boundaries on nature and

The Facilitator’s Catechism    97 
 
length of affiliation (such as what was required of workshops 
between the IEEE and USSR during the Cold War [191,192]). 
• The OPORD itself may need to act as a “call for collaborators” 
to which potential members may respond in order to join. 
Header 
The Header of the Facilitator’s Catechism is included as the first item 
in the document and contains a full title of the project followed by 
seven items: 
1. 
Unique Project Callsign 
2. 
Team Name 
3. 
Facilitator 
4. 
Facilitator Contact Information 
5. 
Date of Announcement 
6. 
Call for Collaboration End Date 
7. 
Intended Date of Completion 
The requirement for a short Unique Project Callsign (UPC) and Team 
Name was selected in the interest of giving the project an easily 
searchable identifier (TeamName-UPC) if the OPORD and related 
materials and deliverables are digitized, much in the same way written 
DARPA presentations and research deliverables can be searched for 
through the use of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) number 
contained both in the announcement of interest and in the resulting 
written deliverables [193]. Even if the OPORD is being used to 
facilitate an IRT or to make a call for collaborators, giving the team a 
name creates a symbol around which culture and esprit de corps may 
be developed [60,66,154,156,194], it also allows for the option to keep 
the team intact after project completion. The Facilitator and Contact 
Information are listed so that stakeholders, potential collaborators, and 
interested parties are aware of who is responsible for execution and 
how to contact them. A Date of Announcement, Call for

Footer 
The Footer is included at the bottom of each page in the document 
and contains three items: 
1. 
The current version of the Facilitator’s Catechism format 
in use, preferably with an embedded hyperlink to the

preferably with an embedded hyperlink to where other

The Page Number of the document 
The Footer is an essential component of the Facilitator’s Catechism, as 
it ensures that the reader can ascertain the current version as well as 
find and compare updated versions. 
Situation 
Building on the battle-tested success of the Five Paragraph Order, 
“Situation” is the first paragraph of the OPORD, and should be used 
to develop a narrative that conveys a situation, problem, or threat to a 
potential collaborator, stakeholder, or interested party. Adapting Eben 
Swift’s notion of the length and detail of this section being 
proportionate to the level of command [3,23], we suggest that the 
length of this section be commensurate with the complexity and 
nuance of the situation requiring the assembly of a team. It is subtitled 
with a set of questions to be answered: 
1. 
What is the nature of the situation or problem the team is 
being formed to address? 

---PAGE BREAK---
The Facilitator’s Catechism    99 
 
2. 
If there are traditional methods which would normally be 
used to address the situation or problem, what are their 
limitations and why are they inadequate? 
3. 
What makes the situation novel? 
4. 
What will happen if this situation is not resolved or 
addressed? 
Mission 
Following the format of many modern OPORDs [3,4], “Mission” is 
included as the second section of the Facilitator’s Catechism. Using 
situation and mission in order follows key principles of necessary 
scene-setting prior to the identification of an ideal as a basis for 
narrative construction and survivability [152–154,177]. Mission asks 
only one question: 
“Given the situation, what are the team’s explicit objectives?” 
The answer to this question should incorporate the principles of 
military staff writing: brevity, clear emphasis, mechanical accuracy, 
readability, simplicity, and coherence [43]. If there is more than one 
explicit objective, the objectives are recommended to be 
compartmented and clearly separated. Mission is heavily emphasized in 
accordance with our conclusions regarding goal-setting and the success 
of mission-focused OPORDs. This question is resilient to future 
changes in group personnel or even the inclusion of adversarial team 
members—as long as the objective is maintained and achieved. 
Potential Avenues of Approach 
The third section of the Facilitator’s Catechism is drawn from the 
“Course of Action Analysis” found within literature on joint operations 
planning [80]. From the point of view of ecological psychology or 
Active Inference, the Course of Action analysis is equivalent to the 
assessment of a “field of affordances” and evaluation of the team’s 
preference over this field [151,173]. Course of Action analysis is 
generally done when situational awareness of potential resources (such 

---PAGE BREAK---
100    The Great Preset 
 
as the skill sets and knowledge of potential collaborators) is limited and 
there may be many paths toward solving a problem or achieving a 
mission [80]. However, instead of using the Course of Action Analysis 
methods provided by military literature on joint operations planning, 
which require a great deal of checklists and supplementary material to 
create a format-valid deliverable, the Potential Avenues of Approach 
section of the Facilitator’s Catechism asks a series of questions which, 
if answered with rigor, will provide a deliverable which is fairly similar 
to that of traditional Course of Action Analysis methods. Additionally, 
for all-human teams or mixed human-computer teams, the Course of 
Action Analysis of the future may include specific reference to action-
oriented machine learning models. To prompt meaningful engagement 
with the challenging area of Course of Action Analysis, the Facilitator’s 
Catechism asks: 
1. 
Given the situation and the mission, what are the potential 
avenues for approach? 
2. 
For each approach:  
a. 
What tools, techniques, or expertise alone or in 
combination are required? 
b. 
What are the risks? 
c. 
What are the potential limitations? 
The Potential Avenues of Approach section allows the writer to 
develop necessary structure for project execution without assuming 
resource availability. The Potential Avenues of Approach section of the 
Facilitator’s Catechism is unique among OPORDs because it assumes 
digitization and versioning (previous OPORD formats were simply 
innovated in a time before widespread file-versioning tools such as Git 
and Wiki). Once a team has been assembled and an avenue of approach 
has been decided, the section is renamed to “Approach” and the 
potential avenues of approach are replaced with the chosen approach. 
The state of this section in context with other sections and the header 
provides potential collaborators with valuable information, allowing 

---PAGE BREAK---
The Facilitator’s Catechism    101 
 
them to identify what stage of development the team is in, the 
likelihood of success, and the length of time the project will likely take. 
Milestones 
The Milestones section of the Facilitator’s Catechism is inspired by the 
“Milestones for Success” section of the Heilmeier Catechism. Like the 
section on Mission, the Milestones section asks only one question:  
“Given the situation, mission, and the avenues of approach, what are 
the milestones that would best indicate the mission’s progress?” 
This area is left flexible as the standards for what constitutes a 
milestone and how they should be written are substantially varied by 
domain [1,80,95,98]. If the avenues of approach in the previous section 
are widely varied in terms of their deliverables, methods, and 
progression, it is recommended that their milestones be separated and 
labeled with their respective approaches. It should also be noted that, 
like some spatial missions, the milestones in online missions might be 
reached in a different order than the one listed in the initial OPORD. 
Considering our earlier conclusions regarding the importance of 
achievability in goal-setting and that process facilitation can apply to 
very long term projects, the Milestones section affords the team 
opportunities to identify and rally around successes and calibrate in the 
short-term. As milestones are completed, they may be marked as 
completed on the document to inform potential collaborators of the 
progress and status of the project. If used in conjunction with a change-
tracking tool such as Git, these changes can be labeled and used to 
produce after-action reports without the need for any additional 
reporting requirements.

short-term. As milestones are completed, they may be marked as 
completed on the document to inform potential collaborators of the 
progress and status of the project. If used in conjunction with a change-
tracking tool such as Git, these changes can be labeled and used to 
produce after-action reports without the need for any additional 
reporting requirements. 
Implications of Outcome 
The fifth paragraph of the Facilitator’s Catechism, “Implications of 
Outcome”, is drawn from the highly unique “Who Cares?” section of 
the Heilmeier Catechism, which presents an opportunity to clarify what 
the impact of a successful mission might be. The “Who Cares?” 
question is considered critical to the success of projects in DARPA, 
given that if it cannot be answered directly or communicated clearly, it 
is likely the case that the project isn’t relevant or helpful [98]. The 
Implications of Outcome sections asks: 
If all or some of the milestones were achieved? 
1. 
What does the success mean to the stakeholders, situation, 
and team? 
2. 
What else might be affected? 
3. 
What work will come next? 
This section helps potential collaborators align on the impact and 
importance of the mission and provides a stable attractor for meaning 
of action in context of the project and team. It is a powerful motivator 
to ground a project in terms of its long-term implications, and how 
they will specifically impact the lives of stakeholders [154].

Administration, Logistics, and Communications 
Following the battle-tested standard set by most modern OPORDs, 
the last section of the Facilitator’s Catechism is Administration, 
Logistics, and Communications. This section provides a single area in 
which all of the supporting details necessary to the coordination and 
management of the project may go. It asks the following questions: 
1. 
Who is the facilitator responsible for the project’s 
completion? 
2. 
Who, if anyone, is the team accountable to? 
3. 
What resources and support elements are required? 
4. 
What resources are already available and how can they be 
accessed? 
5. 
What are the requirements for participation? 
6. 
How will the group communicate? 
7. 
Where and how will the work be done? 
8. 
Under what circumstances will the project close and the 
group disintegrate? 
 
For various kinds of IRTs and online projects, Administrative, 
Logistical, 
and 
Communications 
details, 
such 
as 
technical 
requirements, tools, and affordances, are essential specifications that, 
much like the previously noted standards for milestones, will vary 
substantially across domains [1,80,95,98]. Questions are thus left fairly 
flexible, allowing the writer to use them as a foundation from which 
they might ask themselves domain-appropriate questions like: 
1. 
What projects has the facilitator run in the past? 
2. 
Who is the client and project manager? 
3. 
How much money will be required? 
4. 
How do users access the document library?

bringing engineers or other specialists onto a call? 
7. 
What chat platform will be used? 
8. 
How long do we have before a proposal must be 
submitted? 
 
Discussion 
To conclude, the Facilitator’s Catechism is intended to serve as a tool 
for the systems engineering of action-oriented organizational behavior 
by structuring the formation, communication, function, narrative, and 
strategy of online teams [60]. This tool’s design incorporates the battle-
tested elements found within the discussion of the origins and histories 
of OPORDs from antiquity to 2020 and presents novel ones in context 
with the cultural influences of various militaries and conclusions from 
analysis of modern research on topics like Collective intelligence, 
Organizational Sensemaking, Active Inference, and the Systems 
Engineering of organizational behavior. In accordance with the clear 
pattern of technology-driven, structural changes in the expression of 
warfare driving the generation and adaptation of OPORDs, this 
OPORD is designed to overcome the limitations of its predecessors 
(see Appendix M) to meet the requirements of modern military, 
intelligence, and civilian IRTs and small teams [29,60,177] in an 
environment which has undergone significant structural changes due 
to factors including, but not limited to, the emergence of new Complex 
Threat Surfaces related to terrorism [29], availability and adoption of 
new technology, and the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) [195–
199]. 
Considering that the impact and adoption of this order is difficult to 
predict, a consequence of the complexity of organizations and the 
difficulty of prediction in complex systems in general [112,176,200–
202], it is not assumed that the Facilitator’s Catechism presented here 

---PAGE BREAK---
The Facilitator’s Catechism    105 
 
will be the final version. The Facilitator’s Catechism presented here will 
be housed in a GitHub repository1 with a flexible license, such as the 
Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License [203], from which 
new versions and variants may be produced and distributed. In 
addition to the difficulty in predicting the impact, the impact may also 
be difficult to study and measure for the same reasons as well problems 
of comparability and collection of samples. In terms of comparability, 
productivity across domains in general is challenging and is especially 
challenging in domains where the work is knowledge intensive or 
dealing with innovation [204]. In high reliability and research 
organizations in which the Facilitator’s Catechism might be most 
useful, comparability of performance between even individual tasks 
within the same organization may be difficult to attain given that these 
are organizations which are characterized by their engagements with 
novelty and generators of novelty such as Complex Threat Surfaces 
[29]. Even if comparability of performance were achieved there would 
be problems attaining the number of samples necessary to glean 
meaningful insights. IRTs and small remote teams may be formed 
instantaneously or rapidly but perform over longer periods that may be 
as short as minutes or as long as years [29,177]. In a future where 
ONFT and Business, Operational, Legal, Technical, and Social use-
case reasonable data standards become commonplace, we argue that 
the challenges of sample size and comparability in measuring 
performance may be greatly reduced. 
In the absence of such standardizations, we recommend the use of 
Serious Games applied through tools like collaborative case-
management software and events like hackathons [177] as a basis for 
overcoming challenges of sample size and comparability. Serious 
Games narrow scopes such that state and outcome can be made 
comparable while also reducing the time-scales of performance to 
allow for collection of a larger number of samples [177,205]. From a 
pedagogical and developmental perspective, serious games can also

Introduction 
The field of cartography sits at the intersection of applied mathematics, 
engineering, geology, geography, user experience, and graphic design. 
Methodologies and concepts from cartography have been creatively 
applied in a variety of fields, such as the application of spatial mapping 
techniques to information in knowledge management, or the use of 
itinerary visualization methods in non-spatial journeys such as learning 
maps in learning management systems. These fields have been 
subjected to their own forms of development and evolution leading to 
new methodologies and concepts somewhat removed from their 
origins [1]. Cartography itself has undergone a great deal of technology-
driven development [2] but would look very different today had it been 
developed as a new field through the creative application of 
methodologies and concepts from those it inspired. As the modern 
information and logistical context presents new challenges and thus 
new demands for maps, we propose a “reimagining of maps” through 
an interdisciplinary synthesis inspired by the interdisciplinary origins of 
maps themselves. 
While geospatial mapping has traditionally fallen solely within the 
scope of cartography, this relationship is subject to a number of 
common 
misunderstandings. 
The 
most 
general 
of 
these 
misunderstandings may be the assumption that cartography is a field 
which is solely concerned with the preparation of geospatial maps. 
Modern 
cartography 
is 
indeed 
concerned 
with 
geospatial 
representation, but the origins of the practice are primarily found in the 
production of maps that were non-geographic, such as maps of the 
stars, maps that informed cultural and religious practice, and maps that 
stressed relationship and categorization over precision in spatial 
representation [3–5]. Further, there is a misunderstanding that, 
historically, maps were in regular use for navigational purposes in 
transit, which was rarely the case [1,6]. In actuality, medieval and 
ancient maps were considered “precious” artifacts [5] often used for 
archival purposes and interdisciplinary (military, geopolitical, scientific, 
and commercial) reference but most parties traveled by itineraries that 

---PAGE BREAK---
Reimagining Maps    109 
 
were informed by maps or by those with knowledge of them [1,6]. 
Histories of cartography indicate reasonable efforts taken by their 
authors to ensure clarity when discussing the subject, regularly using 
terms like “geographical”, “maritime”, and “terrestrial” [7,8] to indicate 
what kind of map is being spoken about, as each came with its own 
quirks and utility [1,7–9]. The objectives of spatial mapping are not 
always about explicit representations of territory, instead, the 
contemporary and historical focus is often more aligned with the 
connection of data to the missions and needs of other disciplines, in 
order to accomplish goals through primarily static, graphic 
representations of space and time. 
In this paper we define the key dimensions of the Geospatial Problem 
Space before drawing associations between the traditional foci of 
cartography (the production of maps and archival sets) and fields such 
as abstract mathematics, complexity science, and information 
governance. The objectives of this paper are to first consider the key 
dimensions of the Geospatial Problem Space and the limitations of the 
field of cartography in its current state and at its cutting edge, and then 
to consider the objectives, strengths, and limitations of diverse fields 
adjacent to cartography such as applied mathematics, engineering, and 
digital pedagogy. These adjacent fields are intended to serve as a basis 
for exploration of the potential future of cartography. Finally, direction 
is provided for future research activities, specifically concerning the 
development of integrative frameworks for geospatial intelligence 
production and user experiences involving: (a) Rapid generation and 
customization of user-aware maps, (b) Signal processing techniques, (c) 
Role-based access systems for collaborative production of artifacts,   
(d) Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT), (e) Next Generation Analytics, 
(f) Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the Loop with Humans & Humans in 
the Loop with AI, and (g) Action-oriented usage of geospatial artifacts.

Part I 
Current State of Geospatial Maps 
Recent changes in medium, mobility, data availability, and 
infrastructure have greatly impacted the field of cartography. These 
technological evolutions have accordingly changed the strengths, 
limitations and objectives of maps, reflected by developments in the 
affordances that cartographers are able offer to users through their 
map products. Here, we consider the strengths, limitations, and 
objectives of modern Cartography in the context of ongoing 
technological changes, before exploring areas of non-geospatial 
mapping to understand where insights for geospatial maps may be 
gleaned. First, we reflect on the current state of maps, with focus on 
ecological, social, and COVID-19-related use cases and challenges of 
2020 (Figure 1). 
Interoperability 
The availability of spatial data online is increasing rapidly, largely 
through catalogs or standalone APIs. These data catalogs fit into 
traditional map production workflows: beginning with the sourcing, 
cleaning, and organization of data, followed by careful cartographic 
manipulations and stylings, resulting in an end product that is a static 
or standalone interactive map (see Figure 2) [14]. The specifics of how 
this pipeline is carried out, depend on the specific features of the 
situation such as the volume of data, update frequency, security model, 
end user platform specifications. At best, the data manipulation 
processes are shared and documented within a code repository like 
GitHub. This transparency and reproducibility help make tools and 
datasets more useful across situations, and thus more interoperable. 
Large, complex datasets often need custom pipelines in order to be 
transformed into useful and interoperable formats. With limited 
standards for aggregation of data prepared without Geospatial 
consideration (flexible attachment to grid, locations, or boundaries) or 
assessment frameworks for geographic coverage, consistency, and 

---PAGE BREAK---
Reimagining Maps    111 
 
change in value over time (related to user dynamics of different source 
mobile apps), the potential power of heterogeneous datasets has not 
been realized or leveraged. If the work is collaborative or intended to 
be auditable, it is essential that data manipulation processes are shared 
and documented within a code repository framework such as GitHub.

From Figure 2 of [12]. D) Map of protests around the United States from [13], 
last updated June 16th, 2020. 
The global COVID-19 response in 2020 has accelerated several trends 
related to the processing and sharing of private sector aggregated 
location data. Governments and companies such as Facebook, 
Mapbox, Simtable and SafeGraph are involved in map products that 
summarize population movement, and data from these efforts have 
been leveraged by researchers to study various outcomes, including 
relating epidemiological outcomes with compliance with movement 
restrictions, with an eye towards developing a leading edge prediction 
of viral resurgence. This urgency and heterogeneous uptake across

different areas has led to significant challenges related to 
interoperability as well as privacy. COVID-19 has revealed both 
problems and opportunities regarding institutional trust and data 
sharing. The value of individual health data in helping governments 
and civilians plan for and react to the spread of disease is inarguable, 
but the lack of a standardized framework for individual governance of 
personal data has led to mixed sentiments regarding sharing, which is 
potentially related to the success of national governance in combating 
the pandemic [15–21]. 
 
Figure 2.    Map Production Pipeline 
Skill Gaps 
The computer science and artificial intelligence communities are often 
concerned with best practices for “mapping” data from one structure 
to another to take advantage of efficiencies or advantages of one 
representation of the data versus another, but the GIS trained 
workforce is broadly unprepared to implement these best practices or 
work with code, databases, or Artificial Intelligence (AI) [22]. Due to 
the specialization silos and changing hiring practices that emphasize 
machine learning, computer, and data science backgrounds, the GIS 
workforce may be in danger of simply being displaced by software

Reimagining Maps    113 
 
developers. For example, common general questions facing developers 
using tools by the company Mapbox are: “how is our data loaded into 
the client side for manipulation?” and “how will we pre-process this 
data on our platform into vector tiles 1?”. Expertise in cartographic 
methodologies and practice are rare to find in the aforementioned 
communities [24–27]. The resulting lack of synthesis in the best 
practices among the domains of computer science, data science, and 
GIS, as well as those between these domains and graphic design and 
user experience engineering (UX), has notable impacts on the 
consumers of maps, who are liable to be overwhelmed with volume of 
data or misled by its presentation. Existing processes and complicated 
delineations of responsibility may, at the least, cause general 
misunderstandings about course of action analysis, and, at the worst, 
lead to tragic failures such as those caused by errors in emergency (US 
911, UK 999) dispatch orders or motorists being left stranded in 
deserts [28–31]. The skills needed for modern cartography are those 
that facilitate the answering of these questions. 
User Awareness 
Overly prescriptive, robotic guidance systems are among the worst 
signal-to-noise ratio offenders in everyday life (e.g. frequent and salient 
“false positive” notifications reduce user vigilance and thus impair 
navigation). At this point, navigational guidance has limited intimations 
of human-level experience and understanding, for example providing 
ambiguous guidance during complicated maneuvers, or being 
disconnected from obvious surrounding phenomena in situations 
encountered on a daily basis. These systems have a limited ability to 
incorporate users' cognitive awareness, and any introduction of existing 
knowledge as a filter would vastly reduce the cognitive load for 
navigation. Further, likely due to a lack of trust in both intent and 
capability of users [32], there are limited affordances for users to update 
details about their environment in order to improve the experiences of 
others and where these affordances exist they often don’t implement

---PAGE BREAK---
114    The Great Preset 
 
best practices on crowd sourcing [33], consequently generating a 
variety of complex threat surfaces for the purposeful and accidental 
introduction of uncertainty [34]. 
Mapping Uncertainty 
There is the eternal challenge of determining whether blank spots on 
the map represent absence of presence or lack of knowledge. In 
OpenStreetMap, an empty place may have already been surveyed for 
structures and none were found, or it is possible that it was never 
evaluated before or recently (and thus may actually have or not have a 
structure at that location). During the 2014-2015 Ebola response, West 
African communities that expanded rapidly in recent decades were 
found to be unmapped, a challenging situation for public health and 
resource allocation. The urban edge and new settlements are ever 
expanding, particularly in newer cities of Global South. We need to 
track the meaning of blank spots globally, perhaps through the use of 
generative models that take uncertainty into account. Some techniques 
do exist that allow for inference in unmapped or poorly-mapped areas, 
for example approaches that soften the boundaries of point and vector 
data [35]. However, the approaches for mapping uncertainty thus far 
have not lent themselves to meaningful to action facilitation in 
challenging situations [36]. 
Existing infrastructure is rapidly overturning as well in response to 
crisis from climate, conflict, and public health emergencies. The impact 
of COVID-19 lockdowns on business closures means that wide parts 
of our existing maps are suddenly out of date. It should be feasible to 
identify entire districts that have overall less certainty of continued 
function. The inability to handle uncertainty, combined with larger 
volume of diversified source data, in rapid production, makes maps 
more vulnerable to unintentional or maliciously injected noise. 
Threat Actors 
In a global world, the security, governance, and trust of maps and data 
becomes even more important. Fundamental data such as GPS is 

---PAGE BREAK---
Reimagining Maps    115 
 
vulnerable to spoofing [37]. Intentional map data spoofing has 
occurred in augmented reality games such as Pokémon Go and games 
which use real-world spatial data to generate their environments, such 
as Microsoft Flight Simulator, both have been known to show 
distorted segments of OpenStreetMap [38,39]. An increasing fraction 
of real-life is enacted online in “social media”, in the gray-zone between 
games and reality. The Ukraine/Russia conflict presents a (possibly 
apocryphal) story about the introduction of intentional changes in 
OpenStreetMap to divert forces into less strategic points on the 
landscape. More well-known are the security risks of wearable GPS-
enabled trackers, which can leak information about sensitive assets 
[40]. In cities and military operations, where maps are in constant use 
to facilitate decision making, the consequences of inaccurate maps can 
be dire. As user-input influenced maps become spaces for conflict 
themselves, there is a critical need for map quality assurance, based 
upon data and pipeline trustworthiness. 
Volume of Data 
Implementation of user-informed systems that account for quality 
assurance and trustworthiness means leveraging huge volumes of data 
in a manner that is sufficiently responsive to on the ground situations 
(e.g. within the expected timescale of interacting with a smartphone 
app, less than seconds). The need for fast decisions means that analysis 
of data must also in part migrate to the edge of the computing network, 
away from centralized server farms and towards the end-user’s 
networks and devices. Increasing power of devices and geospatial 
processing libraries means less round-trip travel for gathering insights. 
Some projects are beginning to explicitly address these challenges, for 
example the US Wind Turbine Database [41] calculates power capacity 
using Turfjs [42,43]. 
As the data environment becomes more complex, along with a growing 
necessity to leverage new open sources, the ability to communicate data 
certainty and chain-of-custody to the end product is paramount. The 
pursuit of these goals has led to problems in data analysis as an ever-
increasing number of sensors and information-producing devices is 

---PAGE BREAK---
116    The Great Preset 
 
making data volumes expensive or untenable to store in totality. This 
necessitates action-oriented, privacy-preserving, and flexible low-
dimensional representations of data, a topic returned to later in the 
paper. In 2020, location and environmental sensors are becoming 
embedded into our devices, vehicles, infrastructure and objects in the 
logistics flow. These sensors are proliferating in number, reporting 
time-tagged location data to multiple aggregators. In 2019, hundreds of 
millions of GPS chips were in use, most commonly attached to a 
networked device, reflecting a market of around $100 Billion USD. 
New geo-positioning systems are coming online in all of the major 
powers. Nearly all new vehicles ship with GPS and network 
components. With a vehicle fleet turnover of 15-20 years [44], it is safe 
to predict that a majority of vehicles will be generating location data by 
the end of the 2020s, either through onboard sensors, or smart devices 
carried by passengers. 
Accessibility 
As technological platforms increase in scale and intricacy, accessibility 
for users and institutions is a key concern. Many contemporary projects 
are making significant strides in spatial mapping reach and accessibility 
however there is still a long way to go. To provide a few examples: the 
NOAA Big Data Program makes very large and ever-growing imagery 
and analysis projects accessible directly in networked cloud computing 
environments [45,46]. Other maritime use-cases of large geospatial 
datasets are also becoming increasingly important for global ecological 
and legal governance [47–49]. Leveraging specifications like Cloud 
Optimized GeoTIFF (Geospatial Tagged Image File Format) [50] 
enables the efficient utilization of large data stores by offering the 
ability to share select views of raster data available over the network. 
Simple specifications like Spatio Temporal Asset Catalogs [51] can 
solve the problem of manually searching for needed geography, time 
and quality over many different holders of satellite imagery, both 
commercial and government. 
These developments in software and database technology are all 
occurring within the landscape of proliferation of government and 

---PAGE BREAK---
Reimagining Maps    117 
 
corporate sensor platforms, in particular, large constellations of small 
satellites like Planet [52]. CARTO’s BigQuery Tiler [53] eases the flow 
from massive data storage and analysis to map production through 
automated transformation of results into efficient network centric 
formats like Vector Tiles [23]. ML enabler [54] reuses the common 
distribution format of web maps (spherical Mercator tiles) to 
standardize and scale ML processing and integration into collaborative 
mapping tools. Edge data capture and processing. “Pixel8.earth” uses 
commodity mobile phone hardware to capture 3d point cloud models 
[55]. The Mapbox VisionSDK allows for on-device image 
segmentation and extraction of real time street level view [56]. These 
projects and others are pointing the way towards accessible and 
powerful geospatial platforms for use by citizens, researchers, and 
policymakers. 
Key Challenge Areas 
Here we distill the challenges listed above into three key contemporary 
challenge areas for geospatial mapping, where significant technological 
advances would not only be plausible and provide remedy for current 
limitations, but may also offer opportunity for a transformative 
reimagining of the potential for the capabilities and generation of maps 
in the future: 
RAPID GENERATION  
OF RELEVANT MAPS 
The challenge of generating relevant maps is linked to the 
difficulty 
of 
integrating 
user-specific 
analytics 
with 
multidimensional, real-time information about the world, 
local ecosystem, mission, and team. Maps are used for 
missions, but when map information is outdated or is 
inaccurate when compared with reality, the use of the map 
can become counterproductive. The wider the gap between 
the map and the territory (due to outdated or otherwise 
incorrect information), the more risk there is for missions. 
The purpose of maps is not just to provide information about 

---PAGE BREAK---
118    The Great Preset 
 
a user’s environment, but instead to provide relevant 
information to facilitate action—if each user or team involved 
in a mission has different roles to perform, then maps need 
to be rapidly rescoped and regenerated in order to properly 
to optimize communication of information, uncertainty, and 
affordances relevant to each of their respective tasks. 
INFORMATIONAL COMPRESSION  
& USER EXPERIENCE 
The users of maps are humans—spatiotemporal technologies 
reflect a case of human-in-the-loop augmented collective 
intelligence systems. Even the “right map at the right time” 
needs to have the correct informational compression for the 
appropriate user (e.g. an evacuating family, a grocery delivery 
driver, a recreational gamer). Too much information 
presented to the user at once, or unintentional noise in the 
representation of the data, can be cognitively expensive or 
distracting, thus contributing to risk of misinterpretation, 
analysis paralysis, or mission failure. The fundamental 
challenges of sensemaking and semantics are fused with the 
unique strengths and weaknesses of large datasets in the 
spatial mapping paradigms of today and tomorrow. 
Additionally, maps are geopolitical conflict spaces, which 
means they are often influenced by threat actors engaged in 
the strategic generation of deliberate noise and perturbations. 
SECURITY, GOVERNANCE,  
& TRUST OF MAP DATA 
The increasing reach and accessibility of maps is highlighting 
problems related to governance, privacy, and security. In 
some cases, the tension between user-annotated and 
automatically-annotated features can decrease trust in the 
entirety of the mapping processes and data sets. At the same 
time, generative algorithms are being used to create novel 
data, to extrapolate what street level view is like from satellite 
imagery [57], or intentionally deep fake landscapes and

infrastructure [58]. Google’s Kartta Labs is looking to 
recreate historic street scenes employing a combination of 
crowdsourced historic maps and deep learning [59]. Research 
in the domain of computer vision is yielding frameworks that 
are becoming more competent at extracting meaning from 
imagery. Notably Facebook produced global population data 
sets [60], and road networks for integration into 
OpenStreetMap [61]. Despite this increase in reach of 
automated annotated map products, in an internal Mapbox 
study, it was found that within a package of over 100 million 
Machine Learning derived building objects released by 
Microsoft for geospatial use cases within the US, there were 
notable cases of natural features, such as boulders and ponds, 
being incorrectly labeled as human structures. In all these 
cases in others, questions about the security, privacy, and 
governance of data are front and center. Without reliable and 
authenticated data, stored in well-governed repository 
frameworks, complex mapping projects will be difficult to 
collaborate on and potentially untenable or insecure. 
Spatial maps aren’t just geospatial. We can “Reimagine Maps” and find 
cartographic insight by understanding various types of maps outside 
the traditional reach of map-making.

Maps in Other Fields 
In order to understand where we can go with maps, we need to 
consider the state of progress in various fields. Here we review 
disparate areas in which “maps” are applied, and consider examples, 
objectives, and limitations of each area. Across fields and use cases, the 
map is a tool that facilitates rapid reduction of uncertainty, often by 
conveying narratives, objectives, constraints, and threats [9]. We can 
consider an abstract map as a relation between data, information, and 
goals. In this light, similarities between geospatial maps of various 
kinds (archival and reference or itinerary) and non-geospatial maps can 
become apparent and provide actionable intelligence for reimagining 
the future of maps. For each section, we discuss the goal of the 
mapping system in focus, in relation to stakeholder requirements, and 
then inadequacies are addressed or identified. 
Process Mapping 
Process mapping is the application of spatial metaphors to the design 
of models of “relationships between activities, people, data, and 
objects” [62]. Where geospatial maps intend to inform the optimization 
of movement of objects in literal space, process maps intend to 
optimize organizational outcomes by helping to navigate the process 
of the production of a deliverable [63,64]. Process mapping has been 
applied inward, to the development of process maps themselves, 
resulting in a variety of methodologies [62], such as the Cobra six-stage 
method [63], BPR (Business Process Reengineering) project-stage-
activity framework [65], and BPI (Business Process Improvement) [66]. 
Many navigation-oriented artifacts may be described as process maps, 
such as Operations Orders, which are used in Military, Intelligence, and 
Civilian teams to navigate toward successful missions [67–69], travel 
itineraries, communications frameworks, server architecture and 
distributed computing [70,71], and software. Process mapping has 
been noted to be of crucial importance to the improvement of the

Reimagining Maps    121 
 
efficiency, reliability, and auditability of business operations [62–
64,66,72–76]. The strict mapping of the passing of precursors and 
products-in-development to end-deliverables has allowed for the 
development of methodologies that help to clarify to map-readers 
exact expectations of input and output as well as variability and 
uncertainty at each stage of the process being described [77,78]. 
However, process mapping also has strong limitations, such as its 
linearity and inability to rigorously deal with complex systems beyond 
the scale of the process mapper’s scope. The value of the process map 
has an inverse relationship with the complexity of the process and the 
potential for novelty and may contribute to a false sense of knowing 
about the nature of the business processes they intend to represent 
[62], leaving organizations vulnerable due to the lack of preparation for 
novelty. 
Software and Software Development 
This potential for novelty in process mapping is not so much a 
limitation in the description of software and business logic, where 
process maps are composed of algorithms and strict data structures for 
the reliable exchange and manipulation of data with expectations for 
linearity and reproducibility at each stage of the process [79]. In these 
domains, process mapping languages such as UML can be incredibly 
expressive [80]. This has resulted in wide adoption in the computer and 
data science communities to express software in development and have 
been adapted in the SCRUM and AGILE frameworks to express the 
workflow of developing the software as well as the software itself 
[81,82]. These communities are not immune from all of the limitations 
associated with process mapping languages however, such as the 
notoriously steep learning curves, strict standardizations, and lack of 
interoperability between not just the standards themselves but between 
models produced by them. This is exacerbated by the lack of codified 
or interoperable ontologies for the state and mechanisms of the 
systems they wish to model [83–85]. A common comment is that it can 
be more difficult to code the representation of abstract objects in 
process languages than it is to code the abstract objects themselves [83]. 
The standard in common use for UML is hundreds of pages long [86] 

---PAGE BREAK---
122    The Great Preset 
 
and interpretations of the standard are often debated, making it 
inexpressive to individuals who are not already familiar with the 
standard. 
As software projects become larger and include components beyond 
the scope of the development team (e.g. open-source libraries used as 
dependencies), process maps can create more burden than they relieve. 
Where process maps for business processes leak value proportional to 
the complexity and potential for novelty within a process, process maps 
for software see diminishing returns and, after some threshold, 
negative returns. This reduction in value is related to the level of 
complication of the process being described. In the engineering of 
complicated systems, it is best practice to institute a separation of 
concerns regarding the various mechanisms within the system [87]. In 
order to meet this demand, many UML maps would have to be 
generated in order to maintain low signal-to-noise ratios for developers 
working on their sections of a project. At the cutting edge of process 
mapping are solutions to these limitations, embedded in frameworks 
like cadCAD [88]. In cadCAD, the entire modeling process can be 
mapped and simulated, and maps can be generated rapidly with scope 
defined to any particular mechanism or the flow of state between them. 
The cadCAD package was developed in the interest of providing a 
generalizable framework for the modeling of Complex Systems but can 
apply to other systems as well. 
Complex Systems 
In Complexity Science, the “map” is a nomadic metaphor that relates 
actors and actions of various kinds [89]. The idea of a map is applied 
across systems and scales, in order to highlight analogies [90–94]. Some 
shared methodologies across these use cases include Bayesian 
modeling, network science, and predictive/counterfactual approaches 
[95,96]. The objective of these maps is to enable understanding, 
control, and design of large emergent or autopoietic systems [97,98]. 
These kinds of maps are used qualitatively as metaphors or 
homologous structures that suggest system leverage points for control. 
These maps can variously take the form of system engineering 

---PAGE BREAK---
Reimagining Maps    123 
 
diagrams [99,100], complex system modeling platforms [88,101], or 
causal “world modelers” as per several recent projects, but also can be 
used as quantitative tools. Causal diagrams are often used in complex 
systems maps because these kinds of models can lead to reduced 
uncertainty about key leverage points for action. Similar to the 
geospatial problem space, interoperable encoding of complex 
ontologies and pipelines for transformation of data seem to be key 
limiting factors within these domains. 
Communications 
In the gray-zone between Geospatial and process maps lie the 
applications of mapping metaphors and methodologies to represent 
communications. Communications maps which intend to represent 
connectivity in physical locations have had to overcome key limitations 
of two- and even three-dimensional Geospatial representations in 
order to include non-terrestrial entities such as satellites which are 
never static in position and are not fixed in position to the Earth. 
Methods to remedy this have included three-dimensional colored 
overlays, re-rendering the map based on timestamp, and including 
supplementary non-spatial maps [49,102,103]. These accompanying 
non-spatial maps are especially important to understanding the flow of 
maritime communications, where most of the communication is being 
done between a series of objects which are in motion and 
communicating information which needs to be routed to a variety of 
destinations over a variety of channels. Some of these destinations are 
spatial, such as a Port Authority, but many destinations can be abstract, 
such as the set of all servers within a company which can parse some 
kind of incoming sensor data from a vessel. Key challenges of this 
mapping are a lack of data standardization and a pileup of low-integrity 
data from the introduction of Internet of Things (IoT) sensor-
technology producing billions of data points per vessel annually [49]. 
Communications maps are being implemented as a part of workflow 
maps in other domains which also have abstract, non-spatial 
paradigms, such as in server architecture, distributed computing tasks 
[70,71], and in the embodied and remote information processes that 

---PAGE BREAK---
124    The Great Preset 
 
are increasingly enacted in the small-group online settings (research, 
education, innovation, etc.), where novel individual and collective 
affordances are available [34,104]. In such situations, team 
communication maps are network representations of the channels of 
information flow among teammates [100]. Team communication maps 
can be reflected visually as a graphical layout, or using other 
visualization techniques from topology, network analysis, and big data 
analytics. The objectives of team communication maps are several-fold: 
to clarify how collaborators are informationally connected, to design 
improved paradigms for teamwork, and to reduce redundant or 
spurious links within a group. Team communication maps are 
specifically designed to deal with the challenges of many interacting 
agents, some aligned and some adversarial/external teammates. 
Modern team communication protocols are primarily through the 
internet, though can also be through other electromagnetic spectrums 
or physical objects. Current limitations of team communication 
mapping tools include the scarcity of usable yet flexible tools, and 
friction with integrating such tools into current team tech stacks and 
behavioral repertoires. 
Knowledge Management and Information Systems 
Knowledge mapping has a variety of definitions, but all reference 
common objectives, which include the facilitation of exploration, 
discovery, navigation, and recovery of information [105–107]. 
Knowledge maps help to connect ideas and observations within a 
framework that allows for disciplinary (e.g. accounting, legal) or 
interdisciplinary teams (e.g. research, military) to make sense of the 
relationships between topics and concepts. Knowledge mapping is 
generally a qualitative, visual task composed of adding and arranging 
different ideas on a canvas to suggest new associations to make, or 
analyses to perform. Knowledge mapping of this kind has become 
popularized as a note-taking tool under the name “mind-mapping” for 
individuals who are looking to improve their work-flow in business, 
research, and education contexts [108,109]. Enterprise Knowledge 
Management Systems (KMS), such as those employed by Palantir and 
similar companies, include the generation of maps that can be 

---PAGE BREAK---
Reimagining Maps    125 
 
extremely quantitative and formalized, especially in specific subfields 
or where extensive semantic data already exist [104,110]. The creators 
and users of these maps generally face the same challenges as those 
found in cartography and software development: learning curves, 
generalizability of data, requirements for versioning, access control, 
and the need for rapid generation of new maps in order to allow for 
separation of concerns or scope for mission by the reader. Enterprise 
KMS have overcome some of these challenges by creating mechanisms 
for interoperability and versioning, and by creating query systems 
which regenerate maps based on stated objectives of the user and the 
information they’re already aware of, but these systems require a great 
deal of work in initial set-up and data integration in order to become 
feasible. 
In the relatively new domain of Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT), 
knowledge mapping is being implemented in order to facilitate the 
opening of the intelligence production cycle to include both members 
of the public and sources of information which are available to the 
public [111]. The “eyes and ears” model which dominated most 
domestic and foreign intelligence operations prior to the 20th century 
was successfully implemented at global scale by the city state of Ragusa 
around the 15th & 16th centuries [112], but the style of implementation 
is not amenable today given the number of individuals and amount of 
information sources available. While OSINT is often noted to be solely 
concerned with the inclusion of public resources in the intelligence 
production cycle, its focus on aggregation and interdisciplinary 
collaboration has led the domain to create a set of methods which help 
to fuse a variety of traditional intelligence gathering methods (see 
Figure 3) into a generalized framework for organizational sensemaking 
at a scale that traditional implementations of the eyes and ears model 
cannot [112,113]. Knowledge mapping in OSINT faces many of the 
same challenges as those found in enterprise KMS with the added 
difficulties from lack of affiliation and pre-existing trust between 
collaborators, as well as concerns with the inclusion of sensitive and 
highly technical materials in workspaces and individuals who have 
various levels of clearance and disparate domain expertise. It has been 

---PAGE BREAK---
126    The Great Preset 
 
recommended that challenges of this kind may be overcome through 
the use of role-based access, user-aware workspaces, better data 
standards, and gamification of tasks [100,104,114].

Education, Curriculum, and Learning 
At the intersection of process mapping and information mapping are 
mapping metaphors in the domains of education, continuing 
professional development, and human resources. The ability to 
communicate competencies and knowledge attained and mapping 
them to the requirements of roles and continuing education has been 

---PAGE BREAK---
Reimagining Maps    127 
 
becoming increasingly difficult as fields of study, roles, and credentials 
become more specialized, which is consistent with early 20th century 
predictions [24–26,115]. The effects of this increasing granularization 
of specialization are exacerbated by two major factors. First, learning 
has become more personalized and decentralized, often being done 
online and outside the context of the traditional classroom. Second, 
deeply tied to the problem of specialization silos themselves, is that the 
communities concerned with the development of education and 
personnel data standards are generally composed of individuals who 
have a strong background in computer science with limited 
understanding of pedagogy or vice versa. As a consequence, many 
competency standards such as xAPI [116,117], SCORM [118], and 
LOM [119] are highly linear and inflexible. Attempts to update these 
standards have generally caused the standards ecosystem to become 
only more byzantine, causing problems with adoption. 
The objectives of many of these efforts was either to optimize 
competency development by rapidly generating and monitoring 
personalized learning pathways in order to identify and overcome skill 
and knowledge gaps, or to integrate approaches found in research from 
outside the realm of traditional organizational psychology in order to 
develop organization-level competencies and performance [120], such 
as “serious games” [104,120] and collaborative creative work [121]. In 
order to overcome current limitations to achieve these objectives, it has 
been suggested that research be directed toward developing 
mechanisms for crowd-sourcing the cataloging of learning resources 
and relationships between learning resources and competencies, 
managing 
incentivization 
of 
crowd-sourcing 
through 
microtransactions, managing trust within crowd-sourced networks, 
and better understanding self-forming human networks, rapid 
optimization of collaborative work, and rapid formation of virtual 
organizations [120,122,123]. 
Ecology and Biology 
The natural world, and the study of it, can inform the study of maps. 
Maps are used in Ecology to map species distributions [124], ecosystem

services [125], and regulated areas for human use through space and 
time. In basic or theoretical ecology, maps exist as abstract or idealized 
spaces in which processes like succession, gene flow, and guild 
formation occur. For applied or conservation ecologists, maps are 
essential in providing information on corridors for animal movement, 
information on the location of genetic diversity, and potential 
sensitivity of different populations to projected climate changes. The 
objectives in ecological studies of maps are to determine how features 
or aspects of ecosystems such as their patchiness or resource 
distribution, influence biodiversity, system resilience, and organismal 
behavior [126,127]. Other goals of ecosystem mapping include 
characterizing the dynamics and (informational, geospatial, ecological) 
components of the niche. Modeling of ecological niches can assist in 
sampling for conservation or utilization. Ecological analyses are often 
at the regional or global scale, and increasingly being used in 
conjunction with sensor or GPS data, to regulate maritime and 
terrestrial activity [48]. Machine learning schemes based upon 
biogeography are transferable into other domains, perhaps because 
biogeographic maps integrate multiscale spatial and temporal 
phenomena, and can integrate predictive and Bayesian methods. [128]. 
Some limitations of ecological modeling include microheterogeneity of 
the niche (e.g. temperature at one level of the rainforest different from 
temperature on the ground), and accurate historical/future prediction 
of climatic trends. Microheterogeneity of the niche can confound 
regional-level predictions, for example in the case where local 
temperature highs/lows can be outside the confidence interval of the 
larger area, it is unclear whether the confidence interval of the larger 
area should be expanded, or how to otherwise include this information 
on variability. The challenge of past and future projections of climate, 
used in niche occupancy prediction models [124,129], are similar to 
issues arising in large-scale climate modeling [130]. At the cutting-edge 
of addressing these challenges in ecology, are large consortium 
projects, 
globally-replicated 
long-term 
experiments, 
and 
spatiotemporal analytics algorithms borrowed from other fields [131]. 
In behavioral ecology, dynamic network representations are mapping

out the interaction patterns of agents in systems like ant colonies and 
schools of fish [132,133]. Beyond ecological cases, there is a long 
history of “map” metaphors in developmental and evolutionary 
biology, such as the case of Waddington’s epigenetic landscape [134], 
the genotype-phenotype map [135,136], and fitness landscapes [137–
139]. Map metaphors for biological systems are linked to causal 
analyses (e.g. mapping between cause and effect) and therefore 
influence policy and culture [9,140,141]. 
Mathematics 
Maps in mathematics often take the form of metaphors for projections 
of data or the results of functions onto visual planes, but these 
metaphors are tied to a generalizable ontology and set of methods for 
managing transformations of data between planes [142,143]. Functions 
are kinds of maps that connect inputs to outputs, for example, the 
function y=2x maps values of y onto values of x that are twice as large. 
Metaphor, ontology, and methods alike provide helpful lenses for 
application and understanding the nature of functions and their 
domain (the objects and values which can be acted on) and range (the 
objects and values which can be produced) [143]. The ontology within 
the mathematics mapping domain diverges a great deal from other 
mapping domains described, most notably in the definition of the term 
“map” itself. The “map” does not refer to the visual projection of data 
on “Plane Y” from data sourced from “Plane X”, instead, the “map” 
is the function through which “Plane X” data are passed in order to 
generate or locate the data which sit on “Plane Y”. 
Mathematical mapping methods have been well generalized to work 
outside the realm of theoretical math and abstraction in physics and 
applied engineering. For example, in the gray-zone of computer science 
and mechanical engineering, these methods allow the “map” to be an 
algorithm, enabling the mapping of complex, n-dimensional objects, 

---PAGE BREAK---
130    The Great Preset 
 
an example being the mapping of stress-tensors 2  to any other measure 
of strain [145]. These kinds of maps enable interoperability between 
standards without the addition of new standards or frameworks as well 
as enable the rapid generation of visualizations and models [145]. These 
mathematical intimations regarding maps overcome the limitations 
found within other map domains described, as maps become 
“generators” of visualizations rather than the visualizations themselves. 
Freed from focus on fixed products, mathematical maps can be linear, 
non-linear, chaotic, stochastic, or whole computer programs with 
humans in the loop, such as AI, and can contain multiple layers of maps 
contained within Markov blankets [146,147]. This is akin to modern 
paradigms in cartography where “maps” are increasingly becoming 
user-informed and user-aware, and being presented in terms of 
dynamical connectors, rather than simply being low-dimensional 
projections of higher-dimensional data. 
The application of mathematical maps represents the cutting edge of a 
number of fields. For example, underpinning the field of cryptology, 
which is concerned with the security and encoding of data, is the 
ontology and methodology associated with maps [148,149]. The 
“hashing” of an object, or the reproducible, algorithmic conversion of 
data into a string of a specified length of random characters is a type 
of “non-homotopic” data transformation or mapping. Non-
homotopic transformations are those which occur using a map for 
which there is no defined inverse or reciprocal (we can transform the 
data from plane XY onto plane WZ, but there is no defined map that 
will project the resulting WZ data back into its original position on the 
XY plane). Where reverse transformations are implausible or 
computationally intractable, non-homotopic mappings can be used as 
a one-way encryption, or hashing, technique. On the other hand, the 
encryption of data is an explicitly “homotopic” transformation in 
which there is one map for encoding data into cipher-data and another 
 
2 Tensors are high-dimensional objects that used in machine learning across different 
domains through transferable algorithms and frameworks such as TensorFlow [144] 

---PAGE BREAK---
Reimagining Maps    131 
 
for conversion from cipher-data back to its original state. Underneath 
the business logic of advanced data manipulation and integration 
frameworks, such as those used by Palantir, are transformations 
described as “isomorphisms”, which are structure- and order-
preserving maps [150,151], and transformations over special kinds of 
maps like “functors”, which allow for the coherent transformation of 
objects from one set or category to another [152,153]. In cases where 
mapping transformation is able to convey some knowledge about the 
strategies available for a specific the starting state and action (e.g. “this 
account has enough money to pay the bill”) while strongly protecting 
other dimensions of the data (such as specific amounts or previous 
transactions), the relationship is known as “zero knowledge”. Zero 
knowledge cryptographic proofs are increasingly relevant for Internet 
of Things (IoT) [154] and cryptocurrency uses [155,156].

Part III 
Reimagining Maps 
The application of mapping metaphor and methodology in many of 
the domains and subdomains described have converged on some 
combination of the three key areas of limitations of modern spatial 
maps raised in the Introduction. However, each domain has 
approached the development of next-generation solutions to their 
shared limitations in unique ways, and these advanced approaches will 
be considered in the reimagining of maps with respect to each key area 
of limitations. 
The Map is Not the Territory 
Many of the domains described faced similar requirements for the 
necessity of rapidly generated maps for managing detail and scope, 
producing maps for a variety of users and stakeholders, viewing maps 
at a variety of scales, and managing the integration of changing 
parameters, user input, and constant flows of real time data. Mapping 
paradigms in mathematics and at the cutting edge of the mapping of 
complex systems and workflow, are potentially helpful conceptions 
and methodologies for the rapid generation of relevant Geospatial 
maps. 
The application of static reference maps in many tasks is now outdated, 
as reference data living in databases can simply be projected on 
command to any number of visualizations or directed to analysis 
frameworks. Now that the data can more easily live at their source or 
in accessible collections, they are frequently used or updated through 
transformations into a more fit for purpose data structure. This 
fundamental turn in cartography towards dynamic data structures 
moves beyond the practice of the mapmaker as collecting data to their 
workspace for human evaluation, to the mapmaker applying 
cartographic transformations to ever updating sources outside their 
control. The static map no longer serves a single arbiter of truth. 

---PAGE BREAK---
Reimagining Maps    133 
 
Rather, mapping can now primarily consist of sculpting the processes 
by which user- and mission-specific maps are generated and delivered. 
This shift toward holding the map in the data allows for the interactive 
visual representations of complex or mechanistically complicated 
systems where no single static representation could possibly 
communicate all of the meaningful components or processes without 
overwhelming the user. 
Using conceptions of maps from within mathematics, where maps are 
generators of the projection rather than the projection itself, paired 
with the gamification and temporary, Instantaneous Remote Teams 
(IRTs) of experts found at the cutting edge of OSINT practice 
[34,100,104]. The traditional mapping procedure of data preparation, 
model creation, cartographic design, layout, quality control, print, and 
dissemination [14] could be greatly expedited and more easily delegated 
to a variety of teams of collaborators and contributors. For each 
encountered map request, temporary teams could be formed from 
domain experts and relevant stakeholders to produce generators for 
the transformations and projections necessary at various stages of the 
procedure [104]. Prioritizing the production of generators rather than 
the production of visualizations has already led to a great deal of 
progress in the enterprise mapping community, converting more 
organizations to this prioritization and creating non-proprietary 
standards for generators as well as the data which they use could yield 
a great deal of value. In addition, the use of Instantaneous Remote 
Teams (IRTs) helps to overcome previously stated problems regarding 
the difficult to attain skill combinations required for successful 
navigation of the entire procedure by a single team or individual. Select 
data scientists and domain experts can be enlisted to focus on case-
specific generators for the often non-routine data preparation and 
model generation or be considered the generators themselves, and 
cartographers and graphic designers can focus temporarily enlist the 
help of software developers or data scientists in generators of layout 
and projections without these skill-sets dominating these areas of the 
procedure. 

---PAGE BREAK---
134    The Great Preset 
 
User/Role/Actor-Centric and Mission-Aware Maps 
With the correct generators, systems can have a model of the end-user 
built-in and use a map production procedure that not only takes end 
user characteristics into account, but also their objectives and feedback 
through the use of gamification. This gamification, through playful 
mechanisms found in Pokémon Go can be used to incentivize crowd-
sourced development of features and notable improvement of 
mapping products.  In the domain of linguistics, Duolingo, a language 
learning platform, has mechanisms to allow expert users to help adapt 
and add to curriculum as a part of their own language learning. 
However, these user-contributed additions are slowly adapted for 
larger populations by more trustworthy users and staff—these 
mechanisms could be used to help inform trust management in crowd-
sourced development of catalogs and map products as well. 
A key generalized objective across all mapping domains is hodological 
facilitation: they need to facilitate pathfinding and sensemaking for 
users intending to orient themselves or their assets toward action. 
Within the domain of this generalized objective are benign use-cases, 
such as finding a place to buy an iced coffee or trying to circumvent 
traffic where failures are measured in minutes wasted, alongside far 
more serious use-cases, such as evacuation during forest-fires, avoiding 
riots and roadblocks during civil unrest, and ambulances circumventing 
traffic, where failure is measured in human bodies and success in lives 
saved. In critical modern use-cases, maps must be generated just in 
time, not with just a visual layout, but rather with a mission-aware 
interface providing a sculpted set of representations and options that 
will either have outsized impacts on mission-success or quickly 
incorporate feedback from failures to do so. 
BOLTS 
Across nearly every mapping domain reviewed, there were limitations 
at the cutting edge concerning, not the availability of data, but the 
ability to rapidly integrate it. At the cutting edge of each of these 
domains, there appears to be an overwhelming consensus that 

---PAGE BREAK---
Reimagining Maps    135 
 
standardization of data is prerequisite to the rapid generation of maps. 
Synthesizing the requirements from each domain indicates a need for 
data specifications which are reasonable for Business, Operational, 
Legal, Technical, and Social (BOLTS, see Figure 4) use-cases. 
One of the primary obstacles to developing such standards in the past 
has been adoption and the inflexibility that, axiomatically, accompanies 
the introduction of hard-coded standards. Universal standards for the 
exact schemas of all data objects that could be of use is unachievable, 
however, borrowing from concepts regarding transformations within 
mathematics may provide interesting insights. It is not necessary that 
all data be universally fit to specific schematics in order to be BOLTS 
reasonable, instead, all that is necessary is that the objects referenced 
within a data object (maritime vessels, individuals, documents), the 
instantiated data object itself, and the schematic which is used are 
accompanied by metadata in order to inform transformations. 
Standards regarding this type of meta-data would allow for greatly 
increased data sharing and cross-platform compatibility while also 
enabling the highest standards of privacy and governance if the 
standards were paired with encryption and decentralized consensus 
protocols. 
Just as mathematics defines maps as the functions which project the 
data, rather than the projection itself, BOLTS standards have the 
potential to provide an infralanguage by providing the standards for 
metadata to inform access and rapid transformation of data across 
frameworks. The presence of such an infralanguage and clear metadata 
would also allow for easier integration of AI into workflows to facilitate 
cross-referencing, discovery, and production, and transformations into 
varied, lower-dimensional forms while maintaining sourcing and 
context.

Fuzzy and Incomplete Data 
One of the great challenges to universal data catalogs is the presence 
of disagreement over not only what should be present in the schema, 
but also on how to handle disagreements and uncertainty within the 
data itself. This extends from somewhat benign cases of “what version 
of the book are we referring to in this library?” to “where is this 
national border?”, the practical impacts of these disagreements can 
range from dangerous to meaningless. Future data and metadata 
standards should incorporate the potential for disagreement and heresy 
within collections and acknowledge sourcing. Further, user-informed 
maps have already become conflict spaces and subject to threat-actors. 
It is possible that the future of maps doesn’t prioritize crowd-sourcing, 
but instead “network-sourcing”. Based on the actual practice of data 
collaboration in OpenStreetMap and Wikipedia: reputation is foremost 
in the level of scrutiny any contribution receives. The anonymous 
crowd is treated with suspicion. Social networks, both in online and 
real spaces, are useful for assessment of the utility or validity of a 
contribution to a network-sourced map product. This requires the 
development of tools that offer algorithms or affordances to users to 

---PAGE BREAK---
Reimagining Maps    137 
 
assess and assign the reputation needed for certain actions or 
visualizations to be accessible. 
Case study for Future Maps 
We now consider the potential impacts of a future of maps which 
includes these priorities and findings through the use of a narrative use-
case based on a scenario offered by the United Kingdom’s Defence 
and Security Accelerator (DASA) “Map the Gap” competition 
[157,158]. 
In the “Map the Gap” competition, teams were tasked with 
surmounting realistic in-field challenges. The context is as follows: 
when expeditionary forces navigate within enemy territory, it is critical 
to mission success that physical boundaries be overcome, not just in 
the short term by advance units (e.g. reconnaissance and special forces 
which operate at the operational reach of the field army), but also in 
the long term by units which have trouble navigating physical 
boundaries such as mechanized support and logistics units [159,160]. 
In the case of logistics and support units, these physical boundaries 
cannot just be overcome once, but must be reliably overcome many 
times with efficiency and robustness [161]. Some of the most notably 
difficult terrain features to overcome are known as “wet gaps”, such as 
streams, rivers, and bogs [157]. 
Rivers in particular offer a great number of unique challenges to 
expeditionary forces. From an engineering perspective, rapid 
construction of bridges requires knowing a number of difficult to 
ascertain variables which include but are not limited to, the profile, 
depth, and other characteristics of the river bed and riparian banks, the 
ground bearing capacity on both the near and far bank, the gradients 
and material compositions of the banks, and the logistics of material 
and equipment access. From a military perspective, bridge building 
requires allocation of equipment which immediately alerts the enemy 
to intent and location of potential river crossings. In addition, all 
current methods of bridge construction in the field place

reconnaissance engineers and their equipment in vulnerable positions 
and take a large amount of time with a high probability of having to 
abandon the site. At the intersection of military, engineering, and joint 
operations contexts is the inclusion of numerous stakeholders and 
domain experts: reconnaissance engineers to identify and choose 
potential sites, expeditionary and joint operations command staff who 
select sites based on current unit positions as well as intent and threats 
after crossing, logistics staff who are involved in this process helping 
to define requirements, and field intelligence who inform stakeholders 
with intelligence products such as briefs and maps. 
In a reimagining of maps informed by BOLTS data specifications, 
allowances for fuzzy data, user/role-centric and mission aware maps, 
and IRTs, this procedure could be greatly expedited and far less 
dangerous. When the obstacle is identified (e.g. a “wet gap needs to get 
mapped”), two discrete calls might be made. The first call would go out 
to a number of individuals from the relevant organizations who have 
the appropriate clearance and domain expertise to form an 
Instantaneous Remote Team (IRT) with the purpose of choosing a 
bridge site, given what is known from remote sensing data and eyes on 
the ground. The second call goes out to create a digital workspace 
which can integrate data and coordinate work between the individuals 
and liaisons of units which are involved in the choosing the site. This 
workspace includes a variety of geospatial data-sets which offer the 
ability to project uncertainty over the structures and details they intend 
to represent. 
When field intelligence liaisons access the project-specific workspace, 
they select a role-based view which offers them data-sets, interactive 
dashboards, and situation reports from various reconnaissance teams 
and unmanned aerial vehicles in the area of operations. Local video and 
satellite reconnaissance data are blended with public source data to 
provide catalogs to users of the workspace to generate two and three-
dimensional renderings of the terrain and relevant objects in the area 
of operations. Situation reports and intelligence data are processed to 
present interactive views that create high-sensitivity and high-

Reimagining Maps    139 
 
specificity warnings regarding the potential for enemy activity. 
Reconnaissance engineers accessing the workspace see none of the 
detection alerts, situation reports, or positions of unmanned vehicles, 
but they do see warnings reflecting the potential for enemy activity and 
probability of detection. If involved engineers want to understand 
further, and have the clearance to obtain this information, they may 
change their role and see additional information. Otherwise, engineers 
weigh the warnings while making decisions regarding where to order 
the deployment of a variety of semi-autonomous, amphibious vehicles 
which carry combinations of sensors and sampling tools for the 
mapping of the variables associated with grading locations for site 
selection. Remote vehicle operators accessing the space, only see 
deployment orders, the positions of other remote vehicles, and 
warnings regarding enemy activity. When operators spot suspicious 
activity, they can submit situation reports which will be seen by field 
intelligence, their command, and other operators. 
Throughout this process support, communications, logistics, and 
command elements are in the loop watching for distress calls and 
requests. Cartographers, graphic designers, and domain experts work 
in concert to respond to requests for information and develop models 
and visualizations that are not available via extant generators. They 
document and enact their process and procedure for developing these 
artifacts in versioned repositories where new after-action IRTs can be 
formed with software developers and domain experts around creating 
generators for them in future operations. The workspace is an 
extension of a Knowledge Management and Command and Control 
System (C2) which allows for the integration of data-streams from 
other related operations and creates special work views for liaisons who 
need to be aware of the overlap between operations, preventing 
friendly fire and other silo-related errors. Command and staff elements, 
related and unrelated to the operation can watch over the area of 
operations and take the view of any user or role to see what they see in 
order to intervene or redirect effectively.

While this example is from the military domain, the approach applies 
as well to similar use in domains of city planning, where joint 
operations command, field intelligence, and military engineers are 
replaced by their civilian counterparts, such as local governing bodies, 
community planners, concerned citizens, and civil engineers. Both 
domains are often caught in a protracted process fraught with non-
productive cycles of arguments exacerbated by hardened interests and 
conflicting goals. In the city planning domain, there may be a large 
amount of existing and acquirable data, such as traffic studies, service 
and infrastructure impact studies, zoning regulations, and legal 
processes to synthesize and evaluate for accuracy and relevance, but 
the planning process itself is necessarily speculative. An IRT model that 
incorporates city officials, developers, residents, and land owners in a 
role-based workspace design that allows them to iteratively comment 
on, evaluate, and develop compromises regarding the possible 
cityscape increases the likelihood of results that are consistently 
beneficial to all stakeholders. 
Each role has overlap with every other, no two maps are the same as 
each map is curating the information required for sensemaking within 
each role’s information niche. Engineers hot-swap generators for 
projecting different sets of data over the map, allowing them to dial in 
to specific factors at different times without the need to request 
laborious production of multiple maps. Given a clear separation 
between datasets and map generators, information can be shared in a 
compartmentalized and secure fashion with trusted and untrusted 
actors on the ground. Joint operations command and city planners alike 
could have full access to add experimental generators for projections 
built from agent-based models and recommendation engines. Maps 
intended for human understanding should be personalized and tailored 
towards role-specific reduction of uncertainty. Map generation can be 
iterated—if the maps presented are not useful, the generators can adapt 
and adjust to that feedback either automatically or with human 
preferences in the loop. Maps intended for use by autonomous vehicles 
are action-oriented reduced representations of local or regional 
conditions and would be customized to run on minimal hardware or in

offline settings.  Running through the entirety of these systems are 
some of the pillars of the future of maps: advanced analytical capacity, 
action-orientation, 
flexibility, 
modularity, 
accessibility, 
and 
interoperability. 
Conclusion 
In this paper we have surveyed the current state of cartography, with 
consideration for the pressures applied by COVID-19 as well as the 
changes in cartographic affordances for areas such as movement data, 
and addressed recent advances in technology are rapidly shaping the 
landscape of maps. We then reviewed a variety of fields adjacent to 
cartography where “maps” play a key role, such as mathematics, 
ecology, project management, and complex adaptive systems. Across 
fields and through history, maps and mappers are beset by similar 
challenges such as: integration of multimodal data, representation of 
uncertainty, user customization, and designing for action rather than 
archiving. We synthesized insights and practices from disparate areas 
in order to provide direction for research to realize a reimagining of 
maps and offered a use-case related to bridge construction in 
adversarial settings to convey what that reimagining might look like.

ABSTRACT 
Innovation teams formed in incubators, research accelerators, 
hackathon weekends, and within organizations need to quickly align on 
narrative, workflow, and objectives in order to achieve success. Many 
of these teams disintegrate or fail to perform due to lack of alignment. 
Operations orders, such as those in use by the military, have 
demonstrable impact on organizational efficacy and success. This 
paper summarizes the history, development, and impact of military 
operations orders, discusses the history and development of their 
business counterparts, and presents the “The Innovator’s Catechism”, 
a catechism-styled operations order for use by early-stage innovation 
teams. This operations order is built from the “Facilitator’s 
Catechism”, an operations order for rapidly formed research teams, 
with acknowledgment for the special information requirements present 
for emergent and early-stage teams that are market-facing.

Introduction 
An invention is something that is new and potentially useful. An 
innovation, on the other hand, is an invention where the benefits, 
financial or otherwise, exceed the costs of developing and executing 
the idea. A patent is one measure of invention. Around 400,000 patents 
are granted each year in the United States for ideas that are new, useful, 
and non-obvious. Sadly, however, 95% of these patents will never be 
licensed, indicating a systemic failure to create value [1]. 
Traditionally, invention and innovation have been seen as branches of 
creativity and therefore resistant to formalization, relying instead on 
sparks of genius or Eureka moments [2]. Despite this, leaders and 
entrepreneurs would dearly love to find ways to lower the cost of 
innovation and prioritize ideas that create the highest value. Innovation 
management is the study of techniques to bring order to this chaos. 
This paper begins with the observation that high reliability 
organizations (HROs) tend to have the highest level of formalization 
or structure in terms of carrying out successful projects. HROs include 
air traffic control, emergency services, space travel, and operating 
rooms where failure is not an option. The military also has a very 
structured operational approach that maximizes coordination between 
subordinate units and minimizes casualties. This approach is known as 
an operational order or OPORD. The paper starts by considering 
whether the structure of an OPORD (or similar device) can be used to 
increase the reliability of innovation management. 
A catechism is a set of formal questions set as a test, most commonly, 
of religious doctrine. In the mid-1970s, DARPA, the Defense 
Advanced Research Projects Agency, famous for inventions like the 
internet and GPS, was struggling to bring more structure to its 
innovation process. The agency introduced a set of questions, known 
colloquially as the Heilmeier Catechism, to help evaluate and compare 
research proposals [3]. 

---PAGE BREAK---
The Innovator’s Catechism    145 
 
Cordes and Friedman (2020) have extended the DARPA catechism by 
overlaying an OPORD structure, which they termed the Facilitator’s 
Catechism [4]. It was always envisaged that the Facilitator’s Catechism 
could be modified for various use cases including innovation 
management. This paper combines the Facilitator’s Catechism 
approach with Blank’s recent discussion on an innovation pipeline to 
produce a family of innovator catechisms. The result is a series of 
structured questions that innovators can ask at each stage of the 
innovation pipeline to improve the reliability and effectiveness of 
innovation teams. 
Operations Orders 
Organization in the cooperative pursuit of common aims and 
objectives is not uniquely human, but the outcomes of the collaborative 
pursuits of our species certainly are. The successes of human 
cooperation are due, in part, to the purposeful, iterative refinement of 
the frameworks, processes, tools, and techniques used to increase the 
reliability and performance of teams. Productive novelty in problem 
solving, or innovation, is required to deal with the modern global 
landscape of challenges. In addition to the digital and internet 
revolutions, the modern workforce is seeing changes in the fluidity of 
team membership and the vertical and horizontal scale of team 
composition, such as increases in bureaucracy, layers of leadership, the 
number of individuals occupying the same teams or roles, and the 
number of remote and temporary workers. In these settings, there is 
an increased emphasis on inter-organization roles, strategies for 
managing workflow, team communication, and organizational culture. 
Organizations use evolutionary pressures and continued study and 
refinement in order to maintain reliable performance [4,5]. Informing 
this refinement in modern times, is research on industrial and 
organizational psychology (IO psychology), sensemaking, active 
inference, narrative construction, entrepreneurship, and high reliability 
organizations (HROs), each providing their own perspectives to reduce 
the enigmatic nature of team performance. 

---PAGE BREAK---
146    The Great Preset 
 
The overlapping domains within IO psychology emphasize the 
psychological and psychometric study of individuals in context with 
their relationship to their roles and the climate and culture of the 
organization in order to discover patterns and indicators associated 
with individual-, team-, and organization-level performance [6,7]. 
Studies in sensemaking and active inference offer useful insights and 
frameworks for understanding how teams and their members 
communicate, parse, and integrate information to update prior models 
of the world and negotiate meaning to facilitate action [5,8–10]. The 
various domains that explore the nature and process of narrative 
construction, such as study of mythology and theology, narrative 
identity theory, psychoanalysis, and memetics reveal the more difficult 
to quantify, emotional and intuition driven aspects of team 
performance, such as esprit de corps [5,11–14]. While IO psychology, 
sensemaking, and active inference provide nuanced lenses and 
frameworks for understanding team performance, the study of 
entrepreneurship and HROs provides meta-analysis of practical case 
studies to facilitate the identification of the key factors, best practices, 
and emergent strategies of both individuals and organizations that lead 
to peak performance and catastrophe [15]. 
One such emergent strategy, independently discovered by HROs in 
varied domains, is the development of use-case specific “Operations 
Orders” (OPORDs) [4]. OPORDs are documents, with specified 
format, that clearly inform a team or organization of specific intended 
outcomes to be achieved and the information deemed necessary for 
the team to achieve these outcomes [16–18]. Use-case specific 
OPORDs are used in project management and business contexts, 
however, these OPORDs are subject to the same evolutionary pressure 
placed on all strategies used in high reliability environments [4]. The 
modern innovation and entrepreneurship environment, both pre- and 
post-COVID-19, have new affordances and challenges that require 
new tools and adaptation of old ones. The experimental OPORD 
format, “The Facilitator's Catechism”, is an OPORD variation 
introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic to help emergent, remote 
teams maintain reliable performance in the absence of clear leadership, 

---PAGE BREAK---
The Innovator’s Catechism    147 
 
physical meetings, or formal organization [4]. However, this OPORD 
may be poorly fit to teams such as early-stage start-ups, fully remote 
innovation teams, and emergent hackathon teams, which have these 
traits but also the added pressure of communicating information and 
goals that are market-related. Startup teams (and their stakeholders) are 
also involved in a collaborative mission that can be viewed as 
presenting the optimal product to the market, so organizational 
catechism-style OPORDs for startups need to have additional 
flexibility to adjust approach and have reduced need to plan for deep 
intra-team adversarial relationships. 
Below, the history and development of OPORDs are summarized and 
the perspectives offered from studies within the domains of IO 
psychology, sensemaking, active inference, and narrative construction 
will be used to discuss the basis for the impact of OPORDs on 
organizational performance. Then, some aspects of the historical and 
modern innovation and entrepreneurship environment will be 
discussed in contexts with the benefits and shortcomings of existing 
business and project management OPORD-like documents as well as 
the Facilitator’s Catechism. Finally, a new Facilitator’s Catechism 
variant, named the “Innovator’s Catechism”, will be introduced with 
affordances and adaptations that have the potential to impact 
innovation teams. 
Military Operations Orders 
Operations orders (OPORDs) are, traditionally, standardized 
documents that are used by national militaries to facilitate action (see 
Figure 1) [4,16,18]. Using clear format, compartmentalization, and 
codified ontology, OPORDs convey expectations of execution and 
allow organizations to rapidly align on common goals, approach, and 
mission-relevant details prior to engaging in military and non-military 
work [4].

The earliest historical instances of their usage and refinement are found 
during the Roman management of an expansive border with frontier 
territories occupied or bordered by recently conquered and fragmented 
peoples [4,19,20]. These conditions meant regular and rapidly 
developing incursions and insurrections, leading the Romans to 
develop protocol for reallocation of strategic assets and security against 
material sabotage which came in the form of OPORD variants such as 
service orders for the delivery of supplies and request of 
reinforcements and sentry orders for managing access to military 
camps [4,21,22]. This idea of specialization of OPORD by department 
or type of mission, will return in a later section on OPORDs in 
businesses. Where sentry orders facilitated explicit process and 
auditability for reliable physical security of supplies [4], service orders 
allowed the Roman Army to maintain operational reach despite notable 
asymmetry between the size and threats of the frontier and the available 
resources at the Army’s disposal [4,19,21]. Emphasizing the 
importance of these service orders in the Roman Military, there is 

---PAGE BREAK---
The Innovator’s Catechism    149 
 
substantial evidence that Rome’s famed road system was not built or 
used extensively for commercial purposes [21], but instead for 
maintaining what is referred to in U.S. Military Doctrine as “Economy 
of Force”, or the effective allocation of military assets and the 
minimization of the cost of their deployment through well informed 
logistics [21,23,24]. 
The next notable developments came in the 19th Century, where the 
new affordance of inexpensive paper offered European armies the 
freedom to experiment with new OPORD format and practice while 
an increased emphasis on standing, professional armies and readiness, 
military-bureaucracy reforms, and more reliable logistics meant that 
militaries had the structural changes needed to allow them to mobilize, 
deploy, and pivot in the field faster, farther, and with less warning than 
ever before [4,24–31]. The French Armies of the Republic began to 
develop OPORDs that were many pages long, precisely detailing every 
action that the unit should perform, however, the mechanical, linear 
nature of the OPORDs was inconsistent with the nonlinearity of the 
battlespace, and historical records suggest that these detailed orders 
were rarely carried out and that the practices surrounding them did not 
propagate [4,32]. Where the French had long, complicated OPORDs, 
the Prussians, as a result of their embrace of the philosophy and 
practice of “Auftragstaktik”, or “Mission-Type Tactics”, developed by 
Prussian generals von Clausewitz and Griepenkerl and the chief of staff 
of the Prussian Army, Helmuth von Moltke, saw the emergence of 
OPORDs that “no longer optimized for detail or technique, but 
instead for mission, narrative clarity, and minimum time for issuance” 
[4,18,26]. 
These OPORDs acknowledged the famed insights of Clausewitz and 
von Moltke: “war is the realm of uncertainty” [24] and “no plan of 
operations survives the first collision with the main body of the enemy” 
[29], respectively. These OPORDs were reflections of the type of field 
orders von Moltke issued during his campaigns, clearly preferring 
general directives with guidance rather than strict orders, which earned 
him criticism but proved effective in the unexpected situations that 

---PAGE BREAK---
150    The Great Preset 
 
required increased flexibility [29]. The Prussians believed that the 
increased fluidity in combat meant that commanders would have to 
rely on communication of objectives and trust in their officers to act 
independently in pursuit of those objectives in the field [4,32,33]. 
The emergence and impact of these formats, and of the underlying 
military philosophy from which they were developed, inspired a U.S. 
Cavalry General, Eben Swift, to establish the first instance of a strongly 
codified “field order” format for OPORDs in 1897 [4,16,32,34]. Swift, 
who had previously served in the American West fighting the Sioux, 
Cheyenne, Barrock, and Ute tribes [35–37], in operations that have 
elements resembling the aforementioned Roman management of 
frontier territories [4,19,38,39], developed this OPORD format, now 
called the “Five Paragraph Order” (5PO), to facilitate the practice of 
“Auftragstaktik” in the field [4,16,18,32,34]. The 5PO prioritized the 
provision of the information necessary to “enable the subordinates to 
carry out the operations [at] hand” [18], and clear communication of 
the commander’s “intimation of the end” [18]—what it was that the 
commander wanted to accomplish, rather than how they wanted it 
accomplished [4,18,32]. 
The 5PO was just one of many significant contributions made by Swift. 
In the domain of military pedagogy, Swift introduced the “applicatory 
method” of instruction at the Army Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, 
which included “tactical decision games” (TDGs) [40] and regular in-
the-field exercises [34,37]. In the domain of operations planning, Swift 
created the “Military Decision Making Process” (MDMP, see Figure 2) 
[40,41] which was a novel checklist and process-oriented approach to 
decision making which could be rendered on a matrix, placing elements 
of the OPORD in relationship to the progression of the operation, 
from planning to execution [40]. All of Swift’s notable contributions fit 
a common theme: adapting the U.S. Military’s Officer Corps to a 
changing environment, one which favored guerilla tactics, flexibility, 
and adaptation in response to rapidly changing circumstances, 
rendering traditional expectations of balance of power obsolete [42–
44]. Swift would later take the principles and practices that he 

---PAGE BREAK---
The Innovator’s Catechism    151 
 
formulated and taught at Leavenworth and refine them in the field 
during WWI and in some of the first notable unconventional conflicts 
and counterinsurgencies of the 20th Century, such as the Punitive 
Campaign and the Moro Rebellion [34,35]. The environment that Swift 
was preparing the U.S. Military for became the norm in the coming 
decades [44–46]. The 5PO was adopted and adapted by other national 
governments [4] and use-case specific variants of the OPORD 
emerged, such as WWI trench-to-trench attack orders [47], or WWII 
attack, defend, and development orders [18,48]. 
A tracking of the history of changes to OPORDs indicates that 
mechanisms, sections, and priorities of their format change in response 
to new affordances, change in the structural complexity of the 
organization and its environment, and increases to the fluidity of the 
battlespace [4,16,26]. Changes to affordances available to militaries may 
include available infrastructure or equipment such as roads [21] or 
communications systems [50] but also changes to the mediums 
available for the issuing and writing OPORDs themselves, such as the 
availability of “tessera” tablets to the Roman Army [22], the availability 
of paper for the 19th century armies [4], or digital affordances in 
modern joint operations [51–53], all of which resulted in new emerging 
practices related to OPORD format and culture [4]. Changes to 
OPORD structural complexity include expanding layers of 
bureaucracy [45] and introduction of doctrine [54] such as the 19th 
century Prussian and French military reforms influenced by Carl von 
Clausewitz and Henri Antoine Jomini [30], joint operations [55,56] 
such as those between American Expeditionary Forces (AEF), the 
French Army, and the British Army during World War I [4,45,47,57], 
and adaptations to physical changes to the battlespace itself such as the 
introduction of trench and jungle warfare [4,47,58]. Changes to 
affordances and structural complexity certainly catalyzed OPORD 
experimentation, however, changes to structural complexity often 
cause changes to the fluidity of the battlespace, or the freedom with 
which Centers of Gravity (COGs), the “strategic centers of friendly 
and adversary strength, power, and resistance” [56,59], in the 
battlespace may shift, and increased fluidity of Centers of Gravity have

provided the evolutionary pressure necessary to encourage the usage 
and development of new affordances [4].

[49] 
However, for all the experimentation and the changes that were made 
to OPORDs in the 20th Century, all “adhered closely” to Swift’s 
original format (see Figure 3) [16]. Further, virtually all military 
OPORDs identified by meta-analyses from Fort Leavenworth during 
the Cold War appear to cohere to the requirement that the following 
items be addressed: 
1. 
The commander’s intent. 
2. 
What limiting or controlling factors must be observed. 
3. 
What resources and support have been allotted. [4,16,18]

Impact on Organizations 
Here we consider the functional features of OPORDs (high reliability, 
fault tolerance, goal-seeking) in terms of how they are deployed in High 
Reliability Organizations (HROs) and other complex systems in nature 
that consist of a massive number of interacting subunits. HROs such 
as militaries, are organizations that are characterized by their 
interactions with Complex Threat Surfaces, or threat surfaces which 
produce non-linear impact if exploited and require non-linear or 
adaptive defenses [44]. HROs earn their name from maintaining 
reliable performance and resilience in environments where small errors 
can create cascading effects and catastrophe [15,60–65]. Given the 
nature of the environments HROs operate in, there is pressure on these 
organizations to adapt and develop best practices for handling the 
myriad of external and internal threats to reliable performance, 
consequently, they are frequently used as the subject of case studies 
done in the interest of making these best practices accessible to other 
organizations [15,60–68]. HROs often converge on the same best 
practices independently when adapting to environments with similar 
threats and pressures [15,44], thus it is not coincidence that modern 
OPORDs appear to cohere to similar standards. 
All reflexive systems, at the scale of both organisms and organizations, 
require ongoing recalibration to survive and thrive. HROs must make 
these recalibrations consciously [15] and at a rapid pace with limited 
information in order to update processes and technology to maintain 
reliable performance [5]. In this cybernetic framing, OPORDs help 
HROs navigate several interconnected key areas of tradeoff, common 
to all reflexive systems, to facilitate successful action amidst 
uncertainty.

EXPLORE-EXPLOIT 
“Explore-Exploit” [69,70] refers to the axis of strategic 
variation related to the adventurousness of the system. 
Exploratory behavior, or global search, is a broad search 
through functional and non-functional regimes. Exploitative 
behavior, or local optimization, is a more narrow search mode 
based upon the incremental improvement afforded by 
considering system states close to the current solution. The 
statistical regularities of the ecosystem and niche are what 
dictate the success, literally the fitness of a given optimization 
process [71]. At the scale of the individual, this tradeoff can 
be anecdotally described as: “sticking with an old favorite 
ensures a good meal, but if you are willing to explore you 
might discover something better” [72]. At the scale of the 
organization, failing to allow experimentation and ingenuity 
in order to optimize exploitation based on current 
understanding of system state will leave operations fragile and 
stagnant in changing environments [15] whereas allowing too 
much freedom to explore may result in “misadventure” [4]. 
Approaches such as cybernetics & active inference seek to 
finesse the explore-exploit tradeoff space through informed 
action and experimentation [70,73]. As the dimensionality 
and ruggedness of the performance landscape increases, deep 
or generative methods become increasingly important [74]. 
OPORDs help organizations balance this tradeoff by 
allowing for rapid alignment on clear goals and situational 
details, which expedites sensemaking and provides a 
constraint on exploitation (objective) that acts as a constraint 
on exploration (situation and approach) [4]. 
LEARN-PERFORM 
Information-processing systems must be able to learn and 
rapidly adapt their models of the world in response to real 
time observations, and then reliably perform work and act 
based on these models. Pedagogical literature informing IO

156    The Great Preset 
 
psychologists and educators defines learning as the changes 
to cognitive structure [75,76], and performance as the 
measurable outputs of behavior relevant to the system of 
interest [75,77]. Optimization of the learning processes do 
not necessarily increase in performance metrics and 
significant changes in performance do not necessarily create 
learning outcomes [75], creating a learn-perform trade-off for 
systems to manage. OPORDs provide constraints for 
learning in the same fashion that they do for exploration, by 
providing performance requirements as a constraint on 
operations, but they also provide opportunities to bridge the 
gap between learning and performance by providing a tool 
for post-mortem analysis [4]. If the OPORD clearly defines 
the goals and performance outcomes, then it can be used in 
post-operation analysis to inform learning that is tied directly 
to performance. 
TOP DOWN-BOTTOM UP 
Topologically, distributed systems can have a centralized 
“hub-and-spoke” structure, a small world architecture with 
both local and global connections, a sparse or dense local 
connective structure, or other types of patterns. Multiple

capturing different aspects of their structure such as the

similarity [78,79]. Commonly described in graphical settings 
is a system’s patterns of “top-down” vs. “bottom-up” 
information processing and decision-making. “Top-down” 
can refer to information and directives that descend through 
a managerial hierarchy, or from more abstract areas of 
cognition into more concrete realizations. “Bottom-up” can 
refer to systemic changes that are driven by inputs and 
adjustments from the smallest or most numerous sub-
components of a system, for example ant nestmates in the 
colony or cells in the brain. Collective behavior refers to the 
properties of interacting system subunits, accounting for the 

---PAGE BREAK---
The Innovator’s Catechism    157 
 
networks of influences that shape group outcomes [80,81]. 
Collective behavioral systems need to integrate top-down and 
bottom-up information streams in order to succeed (e.g. not 
rely too heavily on sensory input nor on preconceptions 
about the world).  
Historically, OPORDs in the military have not provided 
bottom-up flexibility due to the limited ability to 
communicate rapidly [4,82]. With the advent of remote and 
asynchronous communication, OPORDs have emerged in 
the gray-zone between military and civilian domains that 
provide some freedom from strict hierarchical control, such 
as the Heilmeier Catechism—where the parent organization 
(Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA) 
gives general guidance on a problem and some situational 
details and the sub-organization (the research team) writes the 
OPORD and sends it back to the parent organization for 
approval [4]. 
The active inference framework deals with how multiscale systems 
simultaneously enact policy while also updating their internal model of 
how policy decisions are related to future outcomes [5,83]. Thus active 
inference reframes and re-navigates some of the tradeoffs mentioned 
above, such as explore-exploit [73], learn-perform [74,84], and top-
down vs. bottom-up [85]. For example, by seeking to experiment in 
ways that optimally inform the organism, complex long-term policies 
can be implemented by agents with deep generative models of the 
world [74]. Active inference emphasizes the role of in-the-loop 
informative experimentation by system, as guided by their deep 
generative model. Under active inference, systems act not to maximize 
their estimated reward at current or future timepoints, but rather 
engage in sensemaking and policy selection in order to optimally reduce 
surprising observations in the future—systems that fail to do this (e.g. 
systems that are continually surprised about key predictions) will soon 
cease to exist.

158    The Great Preset 
 
As 
information-innovation 
ecosystems 
worldwide 
become 
exponentially more complicated and technical, forming teams require 
well-designed interventions and scaffoldings. Operation Orders 
(OPORDs) are one such intervention. This modern increase in 
operational complexity for startups and other small teams is enabled 
by access to online and remote collaborators, an affordance that 
military and non-market-facing organizations have been optimizing for 
decades. Such organizations use OPORDs to communicate about 
proposed or mandated projects. Changes in technology are associated 
with changes in the norms and formats of OPORDs in military 
contexts [4], and arguably the same relationship between technological 
advances and logistical innovations exists in the business domain. To 
highlight domains of function interface between market-facing and 
non-market-facing operations orders, below we trace the history, 
educational systems, and uses of business-related OPORD-like 
frameworks and documents. 
Business Operations Orders 
Like any organization, a business needs to coordinate the activities of 
its various departments to ensure it reaches its desired goals. Most 
commonly the overarching goal of a commercial enterprise is to 
maximize shareholder value [86] but business organizations must also 
consider other aims as well (e.g. as a public-good corporation, 
hackathon, etc.). One of the earliest examples of detailed orders to a 
commercial enterprise is the instructions to the Virginia Colony from 
the Court of King James in 1606 [87]. The instructions accompanied 
the official charter that established the colony, which was more 
concerned with the size of the land grant and rights of the stockholders, 
including issues of governance and inheritance.  The instructions 
themselves included several practical details, such as selecting a site, 
dealing with inhabitants, and how to explore the country. For instance: 
“When you have discovered as far up the river as you mean to plant 
yourselves, and landed your victuals and munitions; to the end that every 
man may know his charge, you shall do well to divide your six score men 
into three parts; whereof one party of them you may appoint to fortifie 

---PAGE BREAK---
The Innovator’s Catechism    159 
 
and build, of which your first work must be your storehouse for victuals; 
the other you may imploy in preparing your ground and sowing your corn 
and roots; the other ten of these forty you must leave as centinel at the 
haven's mouth. The other forty you may imploy for two months in 
discovery of the river above you, and on the country about you” (para 6) 
Unlike later military OPORDS, these instructions were not structured 
into a standard set of paragraphs. The business world would have to 
wait until the early 20th century to see some formalization start to arise 
in its approach to operational instructions. 
The first undergraduate degree in business was established at Wharton 
in 1881, followed later by the MBA program at Harvard in 1908 [88]. 
The advent of the railroad and telegraph had greatly expanded the size 
and scope of enterprises leading to the establishment of a managerial 
class to coordinate operations [89]. Business degrees were created to 
educate this new elite [90]. By 1920, Harvard had established a required 
course in business policy in the second year of its MBA program 
focused on the problems faced by top managers [88].  Senior managers 
brought examples of problems they were facing to class, with students 
preparing recommendations, and the managers critiquing the 
proposals. Students were expected to generalize a set of approaches (or 
policies) from the examples presented. By 1951, the curriculum had 
morphed into a set of cases that focused on sizing up a situation, 
planning a program of action, organizing personnel and putting plans 
into action, and control/re-appraisal [88,91]. Scholars have attributed 
this development, in part, to exposure to military planning techniques 
during the Second World War [90] and there are clear parallels between 
the textbook process and military OPORDS, as well as between these 
developments and the development of the OPORD itself. 
The 1960s represented a golden age for the strategy industry. Business 
schools started teaching SWOT analysis, several seminal books on 
corporate strategy were published, a majority of corporations 
established strategic planning departments, strategy consulting firms 
were founded, and computer models were developed to optimize 

---PAGE BREAK---
160    The Great Preset 
 
profits [90]. Corporations routinely forecasted financial outcomes up 
to twenty years into the future. The flaws of this approach were 
exposed during the oil crises of the early 1970s when oil prices soared 
along with inflation. Carefully crafted forecasts were thrown into 
disarray leading to a call to embrace uncertain futures through tools 
such as scenario planning [92]. Learning and adaptation became more 
important than predicting the future or creating inflexible plans [93]. 
Some even advocated eliminating uncertainty by actively seeking to 
shape the environment [94]. 
Mintzberg [93] has argued that strategic plans are a form of strategic 
programming that coordinate the various functions of the organization 
once a creative strategy (or vision or direction) has been selected. In 
his view, a staff of planners are structurally incapable of creating novel 
strategies as they are typically removed from the realities of the day-to-
day business. “Formal procedures will never be able to forecast 
discontinuities, inform detached managers, or create novel strategies” 
(p. 111). However, once given a strategic direction, the planner-as-
programmer can develop the operational implications of the approach 
for the organization. 
Mintzberg [93] goes on to divide strategic programming into three 
components, codification, elaboration, and conversion: 
Codification means converting a broad vision into 
operational terms. For instance, a strategy to offer more 
online offerings lacks specificity for operational managers. 
Planners can break this down into specific objectives for 
various units such as growing online sales by 5% per annum 
or to 30% of total sales within 5 years. 
Elaboration means breaking down these objectives into the 
specific tasks and actions that must be undertaken to realize 
the objectives. For instance, warehouse space might need to 
grow to house online inventory. Some parts of the 
organization must be tasked with growing warehouse capacity 

---PAGE BREAK---
The Innovator’s Catechism    161 
 
and planners can outline the timing and resources required to 
do so. Elaboration is the task of providing action plans to 
organizational units and is most analogous to military 
OPORDS. 
Conversion means updating the organization’s policies and 
procedures to reflect the new strategic direction. For instance, 
an online strategy has implications for payment, shipping, and 
return policies that might be quite different from the policies 
in place for brick-and-mortar operations. Part of making a 
strategy ‘stick’ is to remove the frictions created by outdated 
or missing policies for a new situation. 
PLANNING FOR STARTUPS 
Startups, like other kinds of teams, can be formally planned or emerge 
informally in response to factors such as common threats, interests, 
and opportunities [5,14,44]. Forming startups are not just learning 
about a sector or skillset, they are also learning about each other as 
teammates, and about the team as a collective entity. Ontologies, 
Narratives, Formal documents, and Tools (ONFT, [5]) can be used as 
a basis for interventions and as a framework to model the process of 
team “forming, storming, norming, and performing” [95]. Successful 
startups are able to blend learning and performing (e.g. during a pivot, 
sprint, or hackathon/collabothon), suggesting that a valuable domain 
of research would be in understanding the interwoven dynamics of 
team development (learning) and productivity (performance). 
The startup community has not been immune to the fashions and fads 
of planning in the corporate environment. The Small Business 
Administration (SBA) was created in 1953 with the ability to issue or 
guarantee loans for small businesses. It is not clear when the SBA first 
required a business plan to be submitted with a loan application but it 
seems the practice was widespread by the 1960s [96]. As such, the 
requirement for a business plan mirrors the growth of formal planning 
techniques during the 1950s and 1960s. The current Code of Federal 
Regulations (13 CFR § 120.191) still requires applicants to provide a 

---PAGE BREAK---
162    The Great Preset 
 
business plan for an SBA loan (see Appendix A for a business plan 
outline). 
Perhaps in response to this institutional pressure from the SBA, it 
became fashionable to require a business plan in other startup settings. 
Venture capitalists emerged in Silicon Valley in the 1960s and started 
requiring business plans [96]. As entrepreneurship courses started to 
gain in popularity in the 1980s, the business plan became a central 
feature of the program with 78% of business schools requiring a 
business plan as part of their entrepreneurship major by 2004 [97]. 
Textbooks also emphasized business plans, specialized business plan 
writing software emerged, and business plan competitions became 
popular. 
Unfortunately, there is very little evidence that having a (good) business 
plan improves the performance of a startup [97]. Although there is 
some evidence that a business plan assists in raising external funds, 
there is virtually no correlation between the quality/quantity of a plan 
and performance [98]. In fact, entrepreneurs report they rarely review 
or update their plans once they have been written and the majority of 
founders on the Inc 500 list of fastest growing companies report 
spending more time on informal than formal plans [99]. This aligns 
well with Mintzberg’s [93] insight that formal planning may, in fact, 
hinder strategy making and creativity rather than enhance it. 
The growing disenchantment with business plans led to a new 
movement in the startup community focused around business models 
rather than business plans. Every military strategist is familiar with von 
Moltke’s famous dictum that “no plan of operations extends with any 
certainty beyond the first contact with the main hostile force”. Steve 
Blank [100,101] paraphrased the statement for the startup community 
as “No business plan survives first contact with the customer”. 
Blank first started teaching customer development at UC Berkeley in 
Fall 2004, arguing that startups needed to “get out of the building” and 
test hypotheses about their assumptions with real customers. Blank’s 

---PAGE BREAK---
The Innovator’s Catechism    163 
 
work was amplified by developments in design thinking that 
encouraged entrepreneurs and innovators to empathize with customers 
through observation and interaction and then ideate on a range of 
possible solutions which could then be tested [102]. 
Eric Ries, a student of Blank, later released The Lean Startup, which 
further popularized the approach by combining customer discovery 
with agile development principles [103,104]. The lean startup approach 
encouraged entrepreneurs to create a minimum viable product (MVP) 
that could generate revenue as fast as possible and then introduce new 
features over time (rather than the traditional approach of developing 
a fully-fledged product before launch). Entrepreneurs were encouraged 
to fail fast and ‘pivot’ away from approaches that were unpopular with 
customers before they ran out of cash (or ‘runway’). 
Around the same time, the first business model canvas was published 
[105]. A business model canvas replaces a 25-page business plan 
document with a single page that summarizes the overall plan in a series 
of categories placed in boxes on the page. The original Business Model 
Canvas (BMC) divided the page in nine categories: revenue streams, 
cost structure, value proposition, customer segments, customer 
relationships, channels, key activities, key partners, and key resources 
(see Appendix B).  Since 2010, a number of other canvases have been 
proposed including Maurya’s [106] Lean Canvas (see Appendix C). The 
Lean Canvas adds problem, solution, and unfair advantage to the mix 
by removing key partners, activities, and resources. In doing so, it 
challenges the entrepreneur to acknowledge existing solutions and how 
the startup intends to be better than the competition. 
Entrepreneurs are now encouraged by leading entrepreneurship 
educators to combine a business model canvas with the hypothesis 
testing approach of Blank [100] and Ries [103] to confirm assumptions 
in the business model. For instance, an entrepreneur might assume that 
customers are willing to pay $10 a month for a streaming subscription 
service. However, after demonstrating a prototype to a group of target 
customers, the feedback might suggest that $5 per month is a more 

---PAGE BREAK---
164    The Great Preset 
 
realistic number. Drawing an analogy to science, the entrepreneur’s 
assumptions are like hypotheses that are tested through carefully-
designed experiments and analysis. In science, as in entrepreneurship, 
experiments should be designed to be informative and actionable, 
whether the results conform to or challenge prior expectations. 
Entrepreneurs test the biggest assumptions first then alter the BMC in 
response to customer (and other stakeholder) feedback.  The iterative 
approach ensures that entrepreneurs build products that people want 
and do not waste time building features and products that will flop 
once they hit the market. As such, Blank [101] describes a startup as “a 
temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable 
business model”. Scaling a company should only occur after a 
sustainable business model has been validated. 
Osterwalder and Blank have also extended the BMC to organizations 
that do not have revenue, such as government agencies in the defense 
and intelligence spaces [107]. In this case, revenue is replaced with 
mission achievement (or impact). Four other tweaks were also made: 
customer segments are changed to beneficiaries, cost structure is 
changed to mission cost/budget, channel is changed to deployment, 
and customer relationships are changed to buy-in/support. The 
resulting framework was christened the Mission Model Canvas (see 
Appendix D). The Mission Model Canvas is an example of the 
productive and bi-directional flow of organizational practices between 
market-facing and non-market sectors. 
The business model canvas enables an entrepreneur to communicate 
the general thrust of a new venture to a group of stakeholders in a 
consistent and parsimonious manner. Investors do not have to wade 
through pages and pages of prose that is often based on very little hard 
evidence. This frees up time to discuss the general viability of the 
offering and the assumptions underlying its success. As data is collected 
and assumptions are updated then the canvas can also be easily 
modified in real time. Using the canvas to test a set of assumptions also 
makes everyone in the organization clear on the roadmap from launch 
to success (or failure). 

---PAGE BREAK---
The Innovator’s Catechism    165 
 
OPORDS are primarily about coordination. Innovation coordination 
is more important in a large organization than a startup (which might 
only comprise one team). However, even in a startup environment, 
there is still a need to coordinate actions with other stakeholders, 
particularly investors. The Business Canvas model is not usually 
prepared for external consumption. Additionally, there can be a 
tendency to use the Canvas a vision board or incoherent bricolage, 
rather than a strategic springboard. 
RECENT THINKING ON INNOVATION MODELS 
Current perspectives on entrepreneurship include several new topics 
that will be discussed here. Many of these changes to startup logic and 
practices have arisen due to technological advancement and changes in 
the innovation/market ecosystem. Fundamentally these approaches 
are all approaching startups with a lens of increased early integration 
and coherence. This need for an “Innovation Stack” was well-justified 
in a recent work by McKelvey: “The problem with solving one problem 
is that it usually creates a new problem that requires a new solution 
with its own new problems. This problem-solution-problem chain 
continues until eventually one of two things happens: either you fail to 
solve a problem and die, or you succeed in solving all the problems 
with a collection of both interlocking and independent innovation. 
This successful collection is what I call an Innovation Stack” [108]. 
Recently Blank has promulgated an “Innovation Doctrine”, 
emphasizing clarity on areas such as context, leadership, innovation 
pipeline, ambidexterity [109]. Blank’s development from the Business 
Canvas to the Innovation Doctrine can be seen as a movement 
upstream in the startup’s causal chain – a movement from scaffolding 
the semantic content and graphical layout of a 2D artifact, to 
augmenting the kind of doctrine or policy that a startup might adopt, 
regardless of their use of a canvas or other tooling. 
One integrative project in the space is the DLS Methodology (DLS 
being derived from combining Design thinking, Lean startup, and 
Scrum) [110]. Another more holistic modern approach to the startup

process is the NABC (Needs, Approach, Benefits relative to cost, and 
Competition) model [111]. 
Gray Zone Operations Orders 
Today, Instantaneous Remote Teams find themselves in the gray zone 
between market facing and non-market facing domains. Recent 
developments to OPORD-like documents have occurred in the gray 
zone between market-facing and non-market-facing domains. George 
Heilmeier, while serving as the director of the Defense Advanced 
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in the 1970’s, introduced a 
“catechism” that has acted as a novel form of OPORD for research 
teams [4]. Catechisms are, traditionally, a set of questions with 
predefined answers that act as a basis to solidify religious narratives. 
Heilmeier’s innovation on the catechism was to allow teams to define 
their own answers to a set of questions related to the research they 
intended to pursue to generate an OPORD-like document that also 
acted as a “pre-flight safety checklist” prior to funding. The Heilmeier 
Catechism format allowed for established teams to distill their mission, 
situation, and approach in a standardized fashion and then present it 
to DARPA for approval. Additionally, this format changed the nature 
of OPORDs by allowing for bidirectional (bottom-up and top-down) 
informational propagation, by virtue of the call-and-response structure. 
The recently introduced Facilitator’s Catechism [4] builds on the 
Heilmeier Catechism in several key dimensions, taking advantage of 
modern affordances and recognizing contemporary challenges 
inherent to today’s informational ecosystem. Unlike the Heilmeier, the 
Facilitator’s Catechism does not assume fixed team composition or 
approach at the outset of the project. This flexibility is important for 
all-online teams, teams with rapidly changing composition, and teams 
with AI actors. The Facilitator’s Catechism introduces the idea of 
versioning from computer code (e.g. GitHub), which allows the 
document repository to be a living single source of truth for the project 
and team. The Facilitator’s Catechism can also act as a call for 
collaborators. The Facilitator’s Catechism was written with research- 
or deliverable-based teams in mind, working in areas that are indirectly 

---PAGE BREAK---
The Innovator’s Catechism    167 
 
market-facing (e.g. grant-funded research). The Heilmeier Catechism 
introduced a new informational affordance by improving the interface 
between project funders and proposed research projects. The 
Facilitator’s Catechism builds on this catechism-mediated interfacing 
of people, projects, and funding with an eye towards unconventional 
and rapidly formed teams (e.g. during emergencies or hackathons). 
The Future of Business OPORDs – What is still needed: 
As noted, development in Business OPORDs is oriented towards 
increasing clarity and success in uncertain or changing contexts. There 
are several areas, listed here, where current business OPORDs might 
be made more effective or flexible, drawing from emerging and best 
practices in HROs, global innovation, and instantaneous online teams. 
Notably, there are complementary sets of insights into OPORD design 
that come from market-facing (business) and non-market-facing (e.g. 
military) perspective. Across situations and sectors, teams must assess 
their situation and find successful policies of experimentation, so a 
variety of practices have converged on asking about the essential 
features of a team’s situation. Figure 4 shows the interfacing of a 
market-facing OPORD-like document (left side, Lean Canvas) and 
non-market-facing OPORD (right side, Facilitator’s Catechism) via 
shared areas of focus (center column). This alignability across OPORD 
formats will return later in the advanced rendering capacities of the 
Innovator’s Catechism.

Currently, organizations are looking across dimensions and sectors to 
find emerging and successful practices related to innovation, especially 
in the global and online settings. Small organizations (such as 
hackathon teams, or startups) are finding value in using computational 
tools of the kind that larger organizations use as well (e.g. GitHub, 
CRMs, Cloud services), which facilitates scaling and onboarding. Large 
organizations of all kinds are looking to small, creative teams within 
and outside of their ranks (e.g. freelancing, citizen science, working 
groups) to produce innovation. In the modern entrepreneurship 
ecosystem, as described above, the trend has been towards increased 
early-stage systematization, integration across domains and through 
time, and emphasis on clarity of mission. With all these recent advances 
in mind, and an eye towards the subsequent introduction of the 
Innovator’s Catechism, we list several areas in which business 
OPORDs could be further improved: 
1. 
There is no reason that Agile techniques can’t be 
applied to the design and testing phases (not just the 
build phase). Sprint plans are OPORDS. They are also 
examples of a time pacing strategy [112]. The pacing 
and rhythm of business OPORDs is similar to 
operational tempo in military settings. 
2. 
Versioning systems, usually used to share and annotate 
code, could help emergent teams build documentation 
from the beginning of their collaboration,  
3. 
Advanced rendering capacities for reconfigurable 
visualization could reduce “work about work” by 
facilitating the rapid preparation of pitch documents, 
slides, and canvas models.  
4. 
Different renderings (e.g. slides, canvas) of formal 
documents could be useful to build Rules of 
Engagement (pre-authorized actions) on hiring, 
spending etc., maintain values and mission documents.  

---PAGE BREAK---
170    The Great Preset 
 
5. 
When OPORD frameworks are ill-defined or contain 
spurious/abstract questions, teams can spend too 
much time on informal preparation/polishing, and not 
enough time on the project/development itself.  
6. 
Complexity

approaches 
to 
entrepreneurship [113–115]. emergent startup and the 
landscape of affordances of different kinds.  
7. 
While “get good feedback & do the most informative 
experiment” is often given as qualitative advice, this 
principle is not formally integrated into Business 
OPORD or presentation formats. This notion of 
optimal experimentation could be developed using 
active inference, a multiscale Bayesian framework for 
action, learning, and development [5,116]. 
The Innovator’s Catechism 
Here we present the “Innovator’s Catechism” (IC). The conception of 
the IC began with the question: “What would need to be adapted 
within or added to the Facilitator’s Catechism to make it more useful 
to early-stage teams in hackathons, working groups, short-term 
committees, citizen science incubators, and similar groups?” The IC 
was then constructed by considering both the value offered by the 
Catechism-styled OPORD, “The Facilitator’s Catechism” [4], to 
organizations while expanding and improving upon previous 
approaches to systematic improvement of start-up processes and 
organizational performance in general to acknowledge the unique 
requirements and limitations of the early-stage innovation and 
entrepreneurship teams, allowing for its use to reduce “work-about-
work” [117] and increase likelihood of success, especially where: 
• 
The team will need to rapidly render information about 
their objectives and approach to a variety of formats to 
communicate to external or parent organizations prior to 

---PAGE BREAK---
The Innovator’s Catechism    171 
 
work or in order to secure resources or provide situational 
awareness at various stages of their development. 
• 
The information requirements and limitations at different 
stages of progress vary greatly, creating situations where no 
single, traditional OPORD would be appropriate at every 
stage. 
• 
Team and project success are market-facing (as opposed to 
the non-market-facing team settings considered by the 
initial version of the Facilitator’s Catechism). 
The IC has affinity on several dimensions with OPORDs in the military 
and high-reliability space, as well as direct mappings to the state-of-the-
art practices in entrepreneurship, and uses the same sections as the 
Facilitator’s Catechism: (a) Header, (b) Situation, (c) Mission, (d) 
Potential Avenues of Approach, (e) Milestones, (f) Administration, 
Logistics and Signal, and (g) Footer with one exception, as Implications 
of Outcome has been replaced with Cost and Benefit. However, the 
IC is unique among OPORDs in that its questions and format are 
dependent on the team’s position in an innovation pipeline, creating 
what could be considered a “family” of catechisms in which new 
questions are added and old ones are updated or expanded upon as the 
team progresses through each stage. At each stage, the questions asked 
of the team are only the ones that provide the key pieces of information 
necessary to ensure success and communicate status given the nature 
of the current objectives and best practices (see Figure 5). For example, 
at the Ideation stage, a team should not prioritize considering a revenue 
model, but at the Pitch stage, a team that has not yet considered a 
revenue model should not be pitching. The information points 
produced by the questions also serve to align the team, provide 
constraints to prevent failure, and can be rendered to numerous 
formats. Below, the Innovator’s Catechism is detailed by stage, with 
Header and Footer discussed separately, as they remain unchanged 
throughout.

The Header section of the IC is included at the very top of 
the document, providing a section for key details about the 
project that should be immediately available to any interested 
party (Project Name, Team Name, Person(s) Responsible, 
Contact Information, Start Date, etc.). The Header section of 
the IC includes key elements from the Facilitator’s Catechism 
but rejects others. For example, due to the nature of an 
entrepreneurial team and the expectations of continuity, 
“Date of Completion” and “Call for Collaboration End 
Date” are removed, as is the recommended “Project 
Callsign”. A Team Name might be the company name, but 
even if the team is emergent, creating a team name separate 
from the task at hand provides an anchor for development of 
organizational culture and “esprit de corps” [5,12,118–120]. 
The “Date of Announcement”, which is a more useful 
wording for the kinds of research projects for which the 
Facilitator’s Catechism was created for, is rephrased as a more 
general “Start Date” to provide an initial start date for the 
current stage as well as give context for expectations of 
current progress. 
The Footer is included at the bottom of each page and it is 
recommended that it provide the current version of the IC 
format in use, preferably with a hyperlink to the repository 
where the version specification is held. In addition, if the 
document is going to be shared outside the context of a 
framework that provides versioning details, such as GitHub, 
it is recommended that the footer also contain a note 
regarding the current version of the team’s IC with an 
embedded hyperlink to where other versions are held.

Stages 
In the context of the Innovation pipeline [121], we can partition the 
startup’s journey as occurring through a sequence of stages: 
1. 
Ideation 
2. 
Curation 
3. 
Pitch 
4. 
Exploration 
5. 
Incubation 
6. 
Integration 
The pipeline is the representation of the ideal journey from the early-
stage recognition of a problem, to the integration of a solution to that 
problem into the market—or, in the case of non-entrepreneurial 
innovation teams, integration into the organization. Each stage is 
represented by its own clear mission, best practices, and information 
requirements, all of which are meant to lead to outcomes that carry the 
team to the next stage (see Figure 6). 
IDEATION STAGE 
At the Ideation Stage, a group has formed around the 
acknowledgement of a common problem. Regardless of context, the 
mission is simple: generate a potential innovative solution to this 
problem. In order to do this successfully, they must clearly define the 
problem and who it affects, as well as choose an approach with 
constraints in order to increase the likelihood of success. Approaches 
revolve around deep questioning related to the problem through 
methods such as empathizing and narration, placing the team in the 
shoes of the users, as well as mind and flow mapping, allowing the team 
to make the problem observable. The IC at this stage asks few 
questions, only what is necessary to begin Ideation and inform 
potentially interested parties as to what is being pursued, who is 
responsible for the project, who the stakeholders are, and how to 
contact the team (see Figure 7).

CURATION STAGE 
The team enters the Curation Stage after it has successfully defined a 
problem, identified the groups of people it affects, and converged on a 
potential innovative solution. The mission is now to demonstrate the 
novelty of and need for this solution. At this stage, best practices 
include approaches like market research and surveys, competitor 
analysis, and use-case development, consequently, this stage has more 
information requirements than ideation. Prior to engaging in work, it's 
important that the team understand the potential costs for the 
approaches they choose, such as purchasing research tools or 
commercial intelligence products, and decide on clear milestones to 
prevent mission or scope creep. The Catechism now adds additional 
questions and asks for updates to those previously answered, as during 
this process the definition of the problem or the groups it may affect 
may have changed. Given that the approaches now become more 
complex and may take longer periods of time to achieve, the IC now 
asks for the key milestones that best indicate progress. For these same 
reasons and the potential for approaches that require a budget, the IC 
also asks for what resources may be necessary to commit to this work 
and the expected costs. 
PITCH STAGE 
At the Pitch stage, the team is now mature enough to define the 
mission that will carry it through the remaining stages: providing the 
value of the solution they developed during the Ideation stage and 
demonstrated the novelty and need for in the Curation stage, 
consequently, its primary objective is now to communicate this mission 
and acquire the resources necessary to pursue it. The team now needs 
to prepare to present its intents to external parties, in a collaborative 
setting (e.g. hackathon, incubator, or startup-weekend) the team may 
need to present their potential project to judges or the community, 
innovation teams within organizations will need to get support and a 
budget to continue, and start-ups have to acquire funding. This is a 
stage that any team may need to return to again and again on their 
journey toward successful integration. 

---PAGE BREAK---
178    The Great Preset 
 
The information requirements at this stage grow rapidly, and the IC 
now includes all questions (see Figure 7). In addition to all of the 
questions the IC asks in prior stages, the team must use what it has 
learned from the Curation stage to define the alternative solutions 
available, as well as the potential early adopters and the channels over 
which they will be reached. The team must also define the approach to 
their evolved mission, the provision of the solution they envisioned, 
rather than the approach to acquiring funding—to this end, they are 
asked to define the advantages and risks offered by the approach and 
the feasibility of success. In addition to milestones, they are now also 
asked for the metrics that would help measure impact of their solution 
and the success of the mission. The team now needs to update costs to 
include the costs associated with the provision of the solution (e.g. cost 
per user) and add the benefits the provision of the solution might 
provide (e.g. revenue, cost reduction). Finally, they are now also asked 
to provide the big picture, if the team were successful and the solution 
impactful, what would this mean? (e.g. an Airbnb for events, a 
YouTube specifically for cooking, this privacy solution for 
Government employees could also be useful in civilian markets). 
The IC has the potential to offer a great deal of value to teams at this 
stage, contributing to informal and formal pitches in several ways. First, 
the IC can be rapidly rendered to the large variety of formats (e.g. 
canvas variants, Heilmeier Catechism, NABC) asked for by different 
organizations and the team may need to present to a large variety of 
organizations (see Figures 8 and 9, and Appendices E and F). Second, 
it allows the team to maintain fully-documented traces of their 
development as ICs’ are versioned at different stages and filled out 
entering new stages, allowing the team to inform any presentations they 
create with a story. Third, it can act as a presentation document itself, 
as a stand-alone brief. Fourth, building on these other value-adds, it 
can be used to quickly create slide decks that include any of the helpful 
formats or use the questions as the narrative structure for their slides 
(see Appendix G). Lastly, it can be used to generate a straight-forward 
elevator pitch, brief, or abstract that communicates a straightforward 
narrative:

The Innovator’s Catechism    179 
 
“These problems are being experienced by these users, and these 
alternatives aren’t adequately addressing their needs. Our mission 
is to provide this value to these users using this approach that (we 
have this advantage in providing)/(provides this advantage). It is 
feasible that we will succeed using this approach for these reasons, 
despite these costs, and these risks. Necessary to pursuing this mission 
are these resources, of which we still require: [needed resources]. 
Using this approach this group would likely be early adopters and 
we’d introduce them to the value we’re providing using these channels. 
These metrics would be used to monitor the impact and these 
milestones would best indicate progress. These are the 
stakeholders. This is the person responsible for the project. 
This is how you contact the team. More information is available 
here.”

AFTER THE PITCH: 
EXPLORATION, INCUBATION, & INTEGRATION 
The IC beyond the pitch adds no new questions or changes to format. 
Teams that have succeeded in progressing beyond the pitch will likely 
have to return it often and are now mature enough to exercise 
maximum freedom of choice. The “missions'' of each stage beyond the 
pitch can now be reflected in the IC as milestones in pursuit of their 
larger mission. The team can now optimize function and update the IC 
accordingly so that when the next opportunity or requirement to return 
to the Pitch stage arises, they can rapidly communicate their current 
position, track record, and all other relevant information in the format 
required while reducing work-about-work—allowing them to focus on 
the mission itself. 
Discussion 
In this paper, we have reviewed the history, development, and impact 
of Operations Orders (ORORDs) in the context of state militaries, 
high-reliability organizations, and entrepreneurship and presented a 
modified Facilitators Catechism [4] that is specialized for early-stage 
innovation teams: The Innovator’s Catechism (IC). 
The IC has several characteristics that distinguish it from alternative 
approaches for facilitating development in early-stage startups: 
Catechism Format. Without clarity of mission, approach, 
and needs, an early startup may bear an unneeded risk of 
failure. The document ensures that the team has a clear single 
source of truth to align on and the questions lend themselves 
to prompting group discussion that has clear deliverables. 
The Question-and-Answer format of the Catechism also 
reduces the need for the supplementary material to ensure 
that it is being filled out correctly.

182    The Great Preset 
 
Narrative Development. The structure of the family of 
Innovator’s Catechisms (see Figure 7) allows the team and 
external parties to consider the relevant dimensions of a 
business approach in the context of a developing narrative. In 
addition, 
stage-formalization 
with 
clear 
information 
requirements for progression clearly marks progress, giving 
the team a compressible and easily communicated history. 
Versioning. Versioning helps the team have a history and 
identity. It can help when later assigning ownership, assessing 
reproducibility, and performing statistical analysis of team 
performance across settings. Versioning with a common 
format allows evaluation of team performance and 
development through time.  
Modularity. The digital and structured input IC also allows 
for fluid reformatting into multiple formats (see Figures 8 and 
9). This fluid reformatting allows for the rapid production of 
customizable presentations in a variety of formats such as 
canvases and slide decks (see Appendices E, F, and G) as well 
as to the Heilmeier and Facilitator’s Catechism formats. This 
modular format also enables clear comparability between 
teams using the IC and between the team’s expectations and 
later performance—offering clarity in post-mortem analysis. 
These features of the IC, among others, have the potential to increase 
the efficacy of early-stage innovation teams by allowing the team to 
quickly communicate its ideas both internally and externally and focus 
on performance and process. The IC acts as the “pre-flight safety 
checklist” that Heilmeier prescribed, increasing the likelihood of 
success while also increasing the speed at which teams that are unlikely 
to succeed disintegrate by forcing them to reckon with the information 
requirements commensurate with their current stage of development 
[4]. The IC specification presented (Appendices H, I, and J) will be

The Innovator’s Catechism    183 
 
hosted using a GitHub repository 1 to allow for new variants to be 
tracked and versioned under a flexible license. It is recommended that 
the IC be used in hackathons, research accelerators, incubators, and 
other innovation related events and initiatives to greatly increase the 
observability, comparability, and likelihood of success of the work 
being performed. The design space of approaches for catalyzing 
healthy, productive, innovative online teams is vast, and the 
Innovator’s Catechism is a first attempt at a catechism-styled OPORD 
specific to use-cases in this area.
